"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away.",0
Going away? For how long?,1
Forever.,0
"Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club.",0
I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him!,2
"Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend.",0
"Draw two card, fatass.",1
"Reverse to you, Jew.",2
I'll get it.,0
He's back!,0
Yeah!,1
All right!,2
Chef! I can't believe you're back!,1
But are you back for good?,0
"Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.",1
"Right. Uh, see ya.",0
"Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?",2
"Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.",0
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.,1
"Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.",0
"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.",2
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles!,1
What?,0
Like what?,1
What??,0
Weirdo.,1
Good.,1
Excuse me?,2
...Chef?? A-are you okay?,1
"Dude, what are you saying??",0
...WHAT??,0
This doesn't make any sense!,1
"No, he's not.",0
NO!,0
"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!",1
"Chef, the police are asking questions about you!",1
"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!",0
"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!",1
"...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.",2
"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.",1
"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.",1
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.,0
Yeah!,2
"All right, come on guys!",1
"Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs.",2
"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?",1
"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids.",1
...Huh?,2
"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!",1
...Dude!,1
NO!!,0
No!,0
"Dude, what are you doing?!",1
Just what the hell is that thing?!,1
HA! I knew it!,1
Knew what?,0
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!,1
"Oh, son of a bitch!",2
"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.",0
"All right, come on.",1
"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.",1
"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.",0
"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.",0
"No, Chef has always been super-cool.",2
So what can we do??,2
"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!",1
Having sex with women.,0
This isn't working.,0
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.,1
"Come on, bitch! Dance!",2
"Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!",2
"Come on guys, we might as well go.",0
"Chef, we're leaving.",0
He's remembering.,0
"It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!",2
"Come on, Chef! You can do it!",1
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!,0
"Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!",2
"Oh Jesus, here we go.",0
We don't wanna hear it.,0
Immortal.,0
...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?,1
"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.",0
We're not leaving without Chef.,0
We're not going anywhere without Chef.,1
No! Hey!,1
"No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!",0
"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!",1
"Chef, come on!",1
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!,2
"Come on, Chef!",0
Here!,1
Run Chef!,2
Get outside!,1
We made it!,0
"Chef, come on!",0
"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?",1
"Chef, we love you.",0
"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??",1
NO!,0
A mountain lion!,2
CHEF!,1
A grizzly bear!,2
Oh my God... They killed Chef.,0
You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!,1
"Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-",2
Oh never mind.,2
"Come on, let's go.",0
"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.",1
"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all.",1
"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off!",1
"Dad, I think Ike is starving to death.",1
What?!,1
"Dad, can we go home, please?",1
"But Dad, I want-",1
Oh hey Kyle.,0
"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?",1
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?,0
Helping my Dad give people fake tickets.,1
"Dad, let's just go!",1
"Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.",1
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too...,1
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm...,1
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.,1
You do??,1
"Righ!  Okay, good.",1
What??,1
Yeah?,0
Going away party? What do you mean?,0
Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!,0
Where's the going-away party?,0
Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER!,2
Who?,2
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?,2
Kyle? Kyle!,0
What?!,0
"You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!",2
Kyle! Du-what is going on?!,0
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.,1
"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.",0
Well... Maybe they'll change.,0
Nooo!,0
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!,0
"Come on, people. Come on, people now.",0
"Dude, what are you doing?",2
"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.",0
"THAT's gay, heh.",2
"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!",0
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?,2
"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.",0
"Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew!",2
"Come on, people. Come on, people now.",0
"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.",0
"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now",0
"Come on, everybody be people now",0
"Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now.",0
Yeah.,0
Ow!,0
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.,0
Smug?,0
So... what do you do for fun?,1
"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.",1
"Yeah, fine, Dad.",1
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.,1
"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!",0
"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!",2
"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.",2
"No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!",2
"Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.",0
Who?,2
The smug?,2
What is that?,0
George Clooney's acceptance speech?,0
What about San Francisco?,0
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.,0
I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.,2
"You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.",2
"I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes.",2
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.,0
"Butters, are you there?!",2
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?,2
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.,2
Turning right at O two four niner.,2
"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!",2
"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!",2
Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!,2
"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.",1
We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!!,2
No...,0
Kyle!,0
Hey Stan.,1
"Dude, what happened??",0
"Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.",0
NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!,1
"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.",1
"Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?",2
"Yeah, I guess so.",1
"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!",2
"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass!",1
"Ah, that's better.",2
What?? What??,0
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!,0
I have no idea!,1
"Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?!",0
Sso?,0
"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??",0
They censored the image of Mohammad? How?,0
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.,1
"Okay you guys, check it out.",1
You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?,2
"Dude, it's a good show.",1
"Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.",0
Yich.,2
"Hehaha, heh.",1
Yich.,2
That's it? That's all they did?,1
"Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.",2
What? What's the big deal?,0
"What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!",2
"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!",1
"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!",0
"That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!",2
Uhhh...,1
"I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong!",2
"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!",1
"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.",1
"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.",1
"Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.",2
"Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?",2
The hell's going on now?!,0
What?,2
Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!,2
Does this mean we don't have school all week?,0
"You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!",2
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?,2
"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.",0
Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.,2
To Los Angeles?,0
"If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!",2
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!,1
"Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?",2
"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!",1
"All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right.",2
Dad? Are you sure there's time?,1
No!,1
Ike? Iiike!  Ike!,1
Ike!  This way!  Iiike!,1
Nooooo!,1
Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work.,2
"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.",1
"Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me.",2
"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.",1
"Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.",2
"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.",1
You know we might not even make it into the studio.,2
"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.",1
So what made you change your mind?,2
I got some sound advice... from an old friend.,1
"Well Kyle, we'd better get going.",2
Yeah!,1
Are you set?,2
I'm set! Let's do this!,1
"All right, let's roll!",2
"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.",1
"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.",2
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.,1
"It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.",2
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?,1
"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.",2
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.,1
"Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand!",2
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!,1
"Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!",2
What are you talking about?!,1
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!,2
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.,1
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled!,2
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!,1
"Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?",2
What?  CARTMAN!,1
"Kyle, stop it!",2
Holy Crap!,2
Ahhh!,1
"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.",0
"Dad, this is stupid.",0
No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH!,1
"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!",2
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!,1
"Suck mah balls, Kyle!",2
This... explains everything.,2
"Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!",2
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.,2
You just want Family Guy off the air...,1
"So long, Kyle!",2
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!,1
"Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.",2
"It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!",2
"Dude, can I go before you?",2
"What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?!",1
Who?,1
"So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?",2
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?,2
"Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.",2
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.,2
"...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.",2
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.,2
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?,2
"Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.",2
Seeya.,2
"Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...",2
"You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..",2
I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.,2
"Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.",2
"I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening.",2
Thanks a lot for the ride.,1
I'll do everything I can.,1
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?,1
"Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.",1
"Oh thanks, dude.",1
"Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!",1
"It won't take long, sir.  Ow...",2
"Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.",2
Wha?  What are they?,2
"Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.",2
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!,2
"Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-",2
Why not?,2
Son of a bitch.,2
"Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?",1
Well well well!,2
Cartman!,1
"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.",2
You fat sun of a bitch!,1
"You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.",2
"Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!",1
"Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.",2
"Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!",1
"Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.",2
WHAT?!,1
"Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.",2
I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!,2
"Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!",2
Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!,1
How the hell did you get out?,2
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!,1
"Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!",2
You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!,1
"You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!",2
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP!,1
I can't let you do that!,2
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!,1
"Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!",2
Ow. Quit it!,1
"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle!",2
Stop it!,2
"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!",2
"No more timeouts, fatass!",1
"Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!",2
"Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed.",2
"Thanks, kid.",1
Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!,1
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!,1
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.,1
What manatees??!!,1
"Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!",2
"No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!",1
"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!",1
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!,2
"Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!",2
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!,1
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!,1
"Shut up, Kyle!",2
"Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.",1
"Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!",2
"Do the right thing, Mr. President.",1
"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.",1
"No gay speeches, Kyle!",2
"If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.",1
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.,1
Yes!,1
"No! No, I hate Family Guy!!",2
Dick Cheney?,1
Who?,0
ManBearPig?,1
"Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.",2
"Just play the game, fatass!",1
"Pass it to me, Cartman?",0
"Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!",2
"All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do.",2
"Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!",1
"Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off!",2
"Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!",0
We know.,1
"Oh, hey Dad.",0
"Okay, Mr. Marsh.",1
"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.",0
He's half man and half bearpig,1
"No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.",2
That doesn't make any sense.,1
"He could be half bear, half manpig.",0
"But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.",0
Hello?,0
Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.,0
I know.,0
"Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.",0
"No, no, it's not that.",0
"Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.",0
"Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.",0
"...Yes, I'm serial.",0
"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?",2
"Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go.",0
"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.",0
NO.,0
"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.",0
"Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.",1
"Ah I don't think so, dude.",2
"Yeah, we've got school anyway.",1
You... have that kind of power?,2
What do ManBearPig droppings look like?,1
What?,1
"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.",0
What are you doing?!,1
Oh no!,0
Hello?,1
Help!,0
We're trapped in here!,1
Somebody get us some help down hyah!,2
"Hello, help!",1
Hello??,2
Forget it! They can't hear us!,1
"You'd better get us out of here, asshole!",2
Me??,0
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!,2
Maybe there's another way out of here.,0
"A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.",1
This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit!,2
"You see anything, Kenny??",1
"Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??",1
"No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.",2
"Cartman, you okay??  You need help??",1
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now!,2
It looks like we're completely sealed in.,1
"There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep.",0
Maybe we should go for it.,1
"You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out.",2
Why?,1
"I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.",2
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.,0
"No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.",2
"No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.",1
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.,2
"Aw, dude!",1
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?,0
"They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?",1
"I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.",2
"Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!",1
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.,0
"All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing.",2
C-Cartman?,1
Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?,2
"Dude, what are you doing?",1
"Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?",2
"Dude, get away from me!",1
"Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around.",2
All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go.,2
"Dude, he's really sick.",0
"Stan! Stan, wake up!",1
Huh? What? Have they come for us?,0
"No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him.",1
"Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.",2
"Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?",0
I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.,2
"We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.",1
"How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.",0
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.,1
"NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die.",2
Come on come on! Pull!,1
"Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!",0
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here.,2
What the hell is that??,1
Cartman?,0
"You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!!",2
"I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!",0
Yes you do!,2
What the hell is that?  Oh my God.,1
"No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!",2
Ruuun!,1
"Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!",0
Grab my hand.,2
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!,1
I can't kick!,2
Yes you can!,1
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!,2
I need your help!,1
"No, you just have to save me.",2
Kyle! No!,0
Agh.,0
"Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!",0
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!,1
"No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.",2
"Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.",0
Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH!,2
"Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?",1
"It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!",2
"That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?",2
Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!,2
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!,1
"Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!",2
Eh!,2
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.,2
"Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.",2
Well he called me chubby!,2
"Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!",2
Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!,2
"Mom, I need another energy drink!",2
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!!,2
"Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!",2
Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now.,2
"Mom, I want a Twinkie.",2
Ha! Hahahahahaha,2
"No thanks, I'd rather naught.",2
The hell do you think you're doing?,2
"Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!",2
Time out?,2
And what exactly keeps me on the stool?,2
"Whoa, how did I do that?",2
"Ummm, no?",2
"All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.",2
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.,2
Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.,2
Because you took my Xbox.,2
"Well, yeah.",2
Yeah. I guess so.,2
"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.",2
"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?",2
"You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.",2
"Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile!",2
"You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.",2
Not interested I'm me?,2
"Yeah, well I don't see why-",2
Hey!,2
"Mom, this guy doesn't-",2
Ah! Quit it!,2
"Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-",2
KNOCK IT OFF!,2
I'm not fat!,2
"Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?",2
"Mom, this is degrading!",2
Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh!,2
Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.,2
"Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!",2
"Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?",2
Mom!,2
God dammit stop ignoring me!,2
"This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!",2
"Quit it, mom!",2
"Ooo, Colonel?",2
"Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.",2
"Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!",2
"Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!",2
"Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!",2
"Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?",2
"Suck my asshole, taco vendor!",2
"Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!",2
"You can't do that to me, I-",2
"Goddamnit, you just can't-",2
Seriously! Ey? Eh...,2
"Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!",2
"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.",2
You can't stay here.,0
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!,2
You'er not staying at my house either.,1
"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.",2
"Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.",2
"Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead!",2
"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.",2
"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.",2
"Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.",2
...Should that really matter at a time like this?,2
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.,2
"All right, I'm back.",2
"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.",2
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.,2
"Aw, Goddammit!",2
What is he still doing here?!,2
"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!",2
Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services!,2
"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!",2
"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-",2
"Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-",2
Seriously! Mom-,2
Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?,2
Mom?!,2
Mom? Mom...,2
Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?,2
"Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.",2
"She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.",2
"Dude, have you lost more weight?",0
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.,2
"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.",1
"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.",2
"Dude, we're not killing your mom.",0
"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.",2
Where am I supposed to get a gun?,0
"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!",2
I'm not shooting anybody.,0
"Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.",2
"NO, Cartman!",1
Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!,2
"You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother.",2
"No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!",2
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.,2
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...,2
Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me.,2
"Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.",2
"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.",2
Tha... thank you?,2
"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez.",2
"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now.",2
"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.",2
Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?,2
"Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?",2
"We're over here, by the cart.",1
"Okay, I'm back.",2
Dude! We've been waiting forever!,0
"Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!",2
"If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!",1
"Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!",2
"Heheh, totally, heheh.",2
"Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven.",1
"H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.",0
"I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.",0
"All right, sorry guys. So where to now?",0
See where I am? It's this way.,1
"Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!",2
"Wow, look at all these people playing right now.",1
"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.",2
Oh crap! It's that guy again!,0
Who is this?,1
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!,0
"Get out of here, asshole!",2
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.,0
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel.,1
"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!",0
You bastard!,1
Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No!,2
That sonofabitch!,2
Who is that guy?,1
"Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.",0
"Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!",0
Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!,0
He's a God damned butthole!,2
"My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.",2
"The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!",1
"We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.",2
"Ddue, we have to try.",0
"Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?",2
"When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?",2
"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?",2
"All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!",2
"Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!",2
"Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.",2
"All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.",2
"The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.",2
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-,2
Butters? What the hell are you doing?,2
"You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.",2
"So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!",2
"Come on, let's do this!",0
Then let's move out!,2
Look! There he is!,0
Everyone hold!,2
He's targeting us.,1
"Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions!",2
"Ike, look out!",1
"All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!",2
Dad??,0
"Dad, get off our teamspeak line!",0
"That's it, screw this game!",0
"Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!!",2
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!,2
"Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.",0
"Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.",2
"We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.",1
"I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?",2
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!,0
"That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.",2
Boars?,1
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.,2
"Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?",1
"Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.",2
"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.",1
"Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!",2
"All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!",2
I'm in.,0
Me too.,1
"Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.",2
"Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.",1
"Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?",2
15 agility.,0
"Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.",2
'K.,0
"Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?",1
"Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?",2
More Hot Pockets!,2
That's übercool.,0
"All right, everyone ready?",2
Let's go get him!,2
"Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.",0
"Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.",2
What's the autolocate macro?,1
Command-0.,2
"Okay, right behind Stan.",1
"Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.",2
"Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.",0
"Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.",2
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.,1
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?,2
"No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.",1
Christ...,2
Cast on him again.,1
Everyone target scorpions.,2
Kyle! Fire spell!,2
Aaaa...  AH! Huh?!,1
"Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?",0
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah!,1
"Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad!",0
"Wait, we need Ben-Gay.",2
Hurry dude!,0
I'm going as fast as I can!,2
"Kyle, you have to keep playing.",0
I can't. Just leave me behind.,1
We can't do this without you now! Come on!,0
"All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...",2
"You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!",0
It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!,2
Bathroom! Bathroom!,2
"All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.",2
"Dude, I'm almost dead.",0
"Kyle, cast arcane missile!",2
"I'm out of mana, I told you.",1
I've gotta heal.,0
Dad? Not now!,0
"Dad, how did you get that?!",0
Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...,0
"Stan, what the hell are you doing?!",2
I got it!,0
Dad!,0
"Dad, no!  You killed my father.",0
His shield and armor spells are down!,2
Attack!,1
Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah!,2
Dad? Dad?,0
"I know you do, Dad.",0
Yes!,2
We did it!,0
Yeah yeah.,1
"All right, yay.",2
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.,2
That was such über pwnage,1
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?,0
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.,2
Oh yeah.,1
"Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.",2
Got it.,0
A wall toilet for peeing in.,0
"Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.",2
"Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!",1
"Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?",2
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?,0
Not yet.,1
"They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.",2
Will you shut up about 9/11!,1
"Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!",2
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!,1
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?,2
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.,1
"Yeah, at least one-fourth.",0
"Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.",1
"...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters!",2
"Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?",2
Aha! Do you see?,2
Where did you hear that?,1
I rest my case.,2
"Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?",1
"That's right, Butters.",2
"Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?",1
What? People see the truth?,2
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all!,2
Oh no...,1
"It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?",2
"Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!",2
For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks!,2
Oh Christ...,1
"We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?",2
"So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!",2
Me??!,1
"Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.",2
"Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters?",1
"All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!",1
Terrible.,1
"But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.",1
Aaaah!,1
"Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??",0
"I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.",1
Well why did you have to involve me??,0
It's not my fault.,1
"All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.",0
Really?,1
"Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?",0
......Dude.,1
That's all I needed.,0
"Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.",0
They are?,1
What? No no no.,1
"Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?",0
...That's retarded.,1
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.,1
Code 234,1
What is it?,1
Anthrax?!,1
"Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!",1
"Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.",1
"Uh, Mr. President, my name is-",1
JESUS CHRIST!!,0
No. Way.,1
He was right. You DID cause 9/11.,0
...Really??,1
Why?!,0
Is the whole government in on this?,0
Kyle! Run!,0
"All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.",0
It just... doesn't seem right.,1
"Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.",0
"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out.",1
"Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that?",0
Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here!,1
Dude! What the hell is going on?!,1
What who said?,0
"Dude, we aren't going to kill you.",1
Oh God!,0
Who the fuck are you?!,1
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??,1
Who are you?,0
You f-figured this thing all out?,1
Aw Jesus...,0
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?,1
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!,1
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!,1
"How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!",0
Stan! What the fuck?!,1
It was all planned out!,0
You knew this whole time? Why?,1
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.,0
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!,0
So you blamed the government?!,1
"Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?",0
"So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?",1
Yuh.,0
"So then, who was responsible for 9/11?",1
Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.,0
"And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.",2
"What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!",2
"Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!",2
I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!,2
Aw Goddamnit!,2
"I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?",2
The hall monit- me?,2
Auth- authoritah?,2
Ahem. Me?,2
"There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!",2
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!,2
"You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!",2
"All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ.",2
Argh!,2
"I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!",2
"Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!",2
"I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go.",2
"Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway!",2
Hands?! Let me see those hands!,2
"Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!",2
I knew it!,2
"Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?",2
"Here, you need a smoke, brah?",2
"You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.",2
"Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah.",2
Huh?,1
What's he doing at his teacher's house?,1
"Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello?",1
"Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??",1
Really?! What's there not to understand?!,1
"He's a little young, don't you think?!",1
All right! We're getting the hell out of here!,1
"Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.",1
Ike?,1
This is nuts.,1
"Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher?",1
"Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.",1
"Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.",1
"Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-",1
"Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!",1
"Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.",1
"Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.",1
"Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.",1
Yeah. She's having sex with a boy.,1
"Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.",1
Yeah.,1
Yes.,1
"What?! No, you don't understand-",1
I think so.,1
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.,1
"Guys, can I talk to you?",1
Sure dude.,0
"I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-",1
"Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?",2
"Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!",1
"Dude, what's the matter?",0
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.,1
...Wow.,0
"Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.",2
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.,1
"What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.",2
"""stick it inside her and pee""",1
"Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.",2
"Dude, I really don't see a problem.",0
"Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.",2
"You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways!",1
They what??,2
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!,1
Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!,2
Well they're doing it!,1
"Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!",2
Hall infraction!,2
"You got a hall pass, brah?!",2
"Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!",2
Get down on the floor!,2
"You like bear mace, icehead?!",2
You're goin' with Christ!,2
"...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.",2
"Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.",2
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.,2
"You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!",2
"Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.",1
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean.,2
"Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.",1
I'm dead to you?,1
Oh no!,2
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.,2
"Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike!",1
"There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!",2
"Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.",1
"No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.",2
How do you know that?,1
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.,2
Who's Beth?,1
"Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!",2
"I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?",2
"Can we get going now, please?!",1
"Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out!",2
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!,2
"Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out!",2
"It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!",2
"You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!",2
"I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!",2
"Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!",2
"I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!",2
"Keep your mouth shut, brah!!",2
Oh crap!,1
Praise Christ! Let's go!,2
Bear mace that guy! And that guy!,2
"Freeze, bitch!",2
It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.,2
"Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!",2
"No! Ike, don't do it!",1
"Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you.",1
"Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship.",1
Ike!,1
"Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.",2
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.,2
"Go ahead, Kyle, do it.",0
I am doing it.,1
"What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.",2
Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...,1
"See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face.",2
"Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!",1
I've done it lots of times.,2
Prove it!,1
"Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.",2
"You're afraid to do it, too.",1
I am not!,2
Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...,2
"Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!",2
Dude...,2
Dad! Dad!,0
"If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??",0
"You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues",2
How do you know??,2
He's right. It's just a spook story.,1
"I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.",1
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?,2
...Smalls.,1
It does work!!,0
Holy crap!!,1
"We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.",0
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.,1
"Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?!",2
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.,2
Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!,2
"No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.",2
Noo!! Nooo!!,2
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!,2
It's still three weeks.,0
"Oh God...  Okay, how long now?",2
Will you shut up already?!,1
HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!,2
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!,2
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?,2
Oh God!,2
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!,2
"You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.",2
"Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.",0
"I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.",2
"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.",1
No. There is something I can do.,2
"All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.",2
Do what?,0
"Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.",2
No.,1
"It's simple science, Kyle.",2
"You'll die, retard!",1
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!,2
"Dude, no way.",0
"Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.",1
"I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself!",2
Ey!,2
"Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!",2
"No! No, it's too soon!",2
"Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.",2
You're gonna help me freeze myself.,2
"Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!",2
"No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea",2
"All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?",2
"All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!",2
Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.,2
"Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.",2
Where am I?,2
"Safe where, butthole?!",2
What??,2
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?,2
"Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!",2
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!,2
No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!,2
Well there could still be a god.,0
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?,0
I wasn't talking about spaghetti.,0
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future.,2
What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!,2
"So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!",2
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.,2
And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?,2
Who are they??,2
Jesus Christ!,2
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.,2
"Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.",2
"We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot.",2
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.,2
Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this.,2
Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans.,2
I got it! I got the Wii!,2
"Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call.",2
Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!,2
Here.,2
Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW!,2
"Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!",2
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!,2
You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future!,2
"I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!",2
"Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.",2
God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials!,2
Tell me about it.,2
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!,2
"Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.",2
I care! Where's the closest toy store??,2
Come on! Come on!,2
"Ugh, finally!",2
I want one of those time-phone things.,2
"Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.",2
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!,2
"Look, I have to have one of those phones!",2
How about a robot? How much for the robot?,2
"Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?",2
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.,2
"Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.",2
"Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools...",2
Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone!,2
Oh God!  Hello?,2
Who is this?,2
What?? Who the hell is this?!,2
Me who?!,2
What?!,2
"Oh very funny, Kyle!",2
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.,2
Listen to this!  Dickhead.,2
"Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!",2
"Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!",2
What??  Who the fuck is this?!,2
Suck my balls!,2
"...Okay, you have one minute.",2
Are you spying on me?!,2
"Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!",2
Hello?,1
What do you want?!,1
"I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!",1
... Uh huh.,1
... I'm hanging up now.,1
"Suck my balls, fatass.",1
"Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you!",1
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!,2
What is the Great Question?,2
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!,2
Garrison? But he's an asshole.,2
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!,2
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!,2
"Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!",2
Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison!,2
Go... Right... Where am I going?,2
Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?,2
So there is no war now in the future.,2
And what was that purpose again?,2
Right...,2
"I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.",2
Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!,2
"Mom! Mom, they did it!",2
"No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.",2
What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!,2
I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!,2
Hello?,2
"...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle!",2
"I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.",0
"My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore.",0
Yeah. Why?,0
What??,0
"Hey, hey! What are you doing?!",0
Yes!,0
"No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!",0
"No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!",0
"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-",0
"I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?",0
"Look, I really need my bike.",0
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!,0
...Yeah?,0
Me?,0
"Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.",0
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-,0
"All right, fine, go ahead.",0
"S- hold it a while, okay?",0
When you shoot the puck to another player.,0
"All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.",0
Why not?!,0
"What, you got asthma or something?",0
"Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.",0
"Oh Jesus, can we just practice?",0
Hey.,0
Jesus Christ.,0
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.,0
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.,0
"I'm not playing, I'm coaching.",0
What are you talking about?,0
I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.,0
I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed.,0
"You got it, Stan!",1
"All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.",0
Oh,0
Ohhh.,0
... I don't know.,0
"No, I think you oughta.",0
"Oh uh, hey Nelson.",0
"Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?",0
"Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?",0
Ogh.,0
"Goddammit, dude, I don't know.",0
"No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?",0
"Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right?",0
"No- dude, I told you I can't do that.",0
Okay.,0
"Coach, can I talk to you for a second?",0
"Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?",0
"All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him.",0
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.,0
"Let's go, Park! Come on!",0
Get near the puck!,0
"Tie? Well, what does that mean?",0
How are you feeling?,0
"Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?",0
Oh boy.,0
But what can I do?,0
"Well, ah, I mean...",0
"Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.",0
"Well, sure we can.",0
"Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?",0
They're not gonna kill us.,0
"Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.",0
Hey that's right. We need a ringer.,0
"Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.",1
"It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise.",0
"All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.",1
"Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.",0
"All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!",0
Huh?,0
Sso then we win?,0
"Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!",0
But it isn't supposed to end like this!,0
Play the Red Wings?,0
Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this!,0
"Hey, can they do that??",0
Oooo.,0
"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?",1
"Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.",2
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!,0
"Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.",2
No he's not.  Is he?,0
I don't know.,1
"I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-",0
"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?",0
Ohhhhhhhh?,2
"Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down!",2
"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.",0
"Yeah, come on! Here we go!",2
"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.",0
Race war! Come on! Race war!,2
"Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!",2
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.,0
"Well, yeah.",0
"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!",0
He told my dad he was...,0
No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude!,2
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...,2
"Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him.",2
Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings?,2
"Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam!",2
Barely!,2
"""Rise above it!"" Get it? Like he can rise above anything!",2
"Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!",2
"Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.",0
God dammit!,0
"Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!",2
"Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!",2
"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!",0
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!,0
What the hell do you want from me?!,0
Then stop being mad!,0
"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.",1
"It's a midget, dude.",2
"Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much.",2
"Say ""Uncle!""",2
"Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""",2
"Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!",2
What was his point?,0
I have no idea.,1
"Dude, I don't get it.",0
I don't get it either.,1
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.,0
...Huh?,1
"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.",0
Yeah. I totally don't get it.,0
"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.",2
Is this all you brought us here to see?,1
"Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.",2
Butters is staying over tonight?,1
"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-",2
"Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.",2
"No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?",2
"Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.",1
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?,1
Kyyyle!,2
"I mean, that if-",1
"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.",2
Hrrugh!,1
"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.",2
"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.",2
You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!,2
What'cha do to Butters this time?,0
"It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth!",2
Dude!,1
"I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!",2
"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?",0
Because that makes Butters gay now!,2
"No dude, that makes you gay!",1
Eh- ...what?,2
"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!",1
Nuh uh.,2
Yeah huh!,1
"Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?",2
"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!",2
You are now.,0
"No, no, it was a stupid mistake!",2
Doesn't matter. You're gay now.,1
"No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?",2
You can't!,0
"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.",1
How?,2
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.,1
Really?,2
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.,1
"...Shit, I gotta find Butters!",2
...Idiot.,1
Butters.,2
"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.",2
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!,2
You ready?,2
"Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!",2
Hang on a second here.,2
"'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?",2
"All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.",2
"...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth.",2
"All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go.",2
Uh!,2
Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!,2
"What are you talking about, fatass?",1
"I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!",2
"You figured that out, huh?",1
"That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know.",2
Except for us.,1
"Right, except for you.",2
And all the people we tell.,1
Why would you tell anybody?,2
"Because it's really, really funny.",0
"...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.",2
"Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face!",2
That isn't funny.,0
"Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!",2
"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.",1
"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.",2
"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.",1
"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha!",2
"Aw man, I've got H O R S now.",0
"Okay, my turn.",1
"Where is it, you filthy Jew?!",2
Where's what?,1
You know God damned well what!,2
Let go of me.,1
"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!",0
"I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!",2
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!,1
"Give it back, Kyle!",2
I don't have it!,1
"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!",2
Shut up!,1
"You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!",2
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!,2
"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!",2
Why... why does that matter?,2
All right. It's a picture ...of me.,2
It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.,2
"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!",2
"Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!",2
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!,2
That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!,2
"I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.",2
"Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.",2
"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.",2
"Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.",2
"But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay.",2
"But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee.",2
"You, you will?",2
It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you!,2
"Mom, she's lying!",2
"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!",2
Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie,2
"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!",2
"Ow! Quit it, dude!",1
"HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?",2
He isn't actually going to show everyone...,1
And now this next picture,2
And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial.,2
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.,2
"What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-",2
...Lame.,2
"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.",2
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.,2
What do you think happens if you do have it?,0
"They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls.",2
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.,2
"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?",2
Somebody in this class?,0
"Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?",2
"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?",2
That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!,2
"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you!",2
"Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!",2
You know what? I'll bet it was you!,1
Me?!,2
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!,1
"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!",2
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!,0
"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan.",2
"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.",1
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing!,2
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.,1
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it!,2
It was him. It had to have been him!,1
Yeah... Or you.,0
"All right, lock that door, Craig!",2
"What's this about, Cartman?",1
"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.",2
"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!",1
"This is a scientific test, designed to-",2
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!,1
"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!",2
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!,1
"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!",2
"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.",1
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.,2
"All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know.",2
It doesn't prove anything!,1
"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean.",2
"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH!",2
Kenny!,2
No way.,1
Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice!,2
"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park!",2
"What, Clyde?",2
"All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!",2
"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!",2
Guilty! I thought so!,2
"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks!",2
"Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.",1
"Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.",1
"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.",1
"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!",0
"Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!",2
You had head lice?,0
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!,2
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath!,2
Uh oh!,2
"Duhude, dude,  not cool!",2
"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.",2
What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?,2
"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.",2
Yeah?,1
"Kyle, are you on your computer?",2
"What? No, I'm sick.",1
Get online. I need you to check something for me.,2
"Dude, leave me alone.",1
"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!",2
What? Why?,1
Get online now!,2
"All right, all right.",1
Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.,2
"Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?",1
"Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?",2
Over a hundred.,1
Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?,2
White Stripes,1
That's funny.,2
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.,2
The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.,2
"Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger!",2
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!,2
"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?",2
"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.",2
Dude.,1
Yeah.,2
"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.",1
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!,2
I guess so.,1
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!,2
Wuh what doesn't follow?,1
"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!",2
Okay.,1
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!,2
"Yeah. Actually, there is.",1
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman?,1
"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!",2
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!,2
I said I will only talk to the President!,2
LALALALALALALALA!,2
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!,2
"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?",2
"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!",2
"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!",2
So then maybe you're wrong.,1
"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?",2
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.,1
"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?",2
Yeah.  What is that?,1
It's my balls!,2
God damn it Cartman!,1
"Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.",2
Yeah?,2
"Yes, Mr. Thompson?",2
Why? Did you find something?,2
A snuke?,2
I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?,2
"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.",2
"Dude, we totally got let out of school.",0
"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.",1
Russian?,0
"Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.",1
So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.,0
"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?",1
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.,0
Oh that's a good idea.,1
Big surprise!,2
Let me have time with him.,2
We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!,2
Where is the detonator?!,2
I can do this aaall day.,2
You can make it stop!,2
"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.",1
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling.,0
Hey.,1
What's going on?,1
...Homeland Security?,1
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!,2
Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts.,2
Where is your son?!,2
Answer it!,2
We got him! I know where he is!,2
"No no, he's my lead.",2
You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is!,2
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!,1
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.,1
"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!",0
"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.",1
...Not anymore you're not.,1
Uuugh!,2
Where is the detonator!,2
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!,2
"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you!",2
"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.",2
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!,2
That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.,2
"Uhh yes, of course?",2
The Russians?,2
The Germans?,2
The Germans again?,2
You can't possible mean...?,2
"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.",1
All right! MapQuest the address!,1
Good thinking,1
"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.",1
"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.",2
"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.",2
"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!",1
"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?",2
...Maybe.,1
"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.",2
...That is so missing the point.,1
"Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!",2
"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-",1
"Yes or no, Kyle?!",2
No! ...Not... not like you're saying.,1
"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right?",2
"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.",2
"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?",0
"Right, so, why do we color eggs?",0
"Yeah, but why?",0
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?,0
"You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.",0
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!,0
"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!",2
"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!",2
"Bye, Easter bunny!",2
"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?",0
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!,0
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!,0
"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this!",0
Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?,0
Dad! You've gotta help me!,0
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!,0
"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?",0
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!,0
Does Mom know about this?,0
I don't understand!,0
"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?",0
So what is the secret of Easter?,0
Grandpa's in it too?,0
"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?",0
You mean the old Galveston Lodge?,0
Must I?,0
Hi Grandpa.,0
...Stan.,0
"Yeah, I wanna know already.",0
Where am I supposed to go?,0
Jesus Christ!,0
Oh no...,0
Help.,0
What happened?,1
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.,0
...I'm kind of finger painting right now.,1
"Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?",0
"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.",1
"Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag?",1
The history of Easter.,1
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men?,0
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.,0
Just bread...,0
It kind of looks like... an egg.,1
Who is Saint Peter?,1
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.,0
Peter Rabbit.,1
I don't see it.,1
He looks like a guy.,0
I don't believe it.,1
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?,0
So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?,1
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?,0
They found me!,0
So what now?,1
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.,0
You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?,1
"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help.",0
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.,1
"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!",0
"Okay, fine.",0
"You said ""hand over the bunny.""",0
"Hey, what the hell!",0
"You swore on the cross, fatso!",1
"Jesus, you did answer my prayer!",0
No! No!,0
Don't you have any superpowers?,1
N-no way! Do it yourself.,1
"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.",1
Don't make me do this.,1
Eric Cartman can never know about this.,1
"Happy Easter, Jesus.",1
...Jesus?,1
Snowball!,0
All right Jesus!,0
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.,0
"Oh God, here we go again.",1
"Uh oh, this isn't good.",0
No ma'am.,0
Have you lost your mind?,2
"Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.",0
"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?",0
Our whole weekend is shot.,1
"You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.",2
We don't?,0
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.,2
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?,2
"Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer"".",2
"Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.",2
"Okay, gracias.",2
"Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.",0
"Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.",2
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!,1
"They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?",2
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.,1
"He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.",1
"That's it, that's the whole story?",0
"All right, did you write the four essays?",2
"Okay, let's have 'em.",2
You said you all wrote essays.,1
"Dude, we're totally fucked now!",1
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!,2
"This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!",1
"You guys, school starts in ten minutes!",0
Son of a bitch!,1
"Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?",0
"Jimmy, did you finish your book report?",1
Crap!,2
We're dead.,1
"Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.",2
Again?,0
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!,2
These guys are pretty good.,0
Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something.,1
"All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.",2
Fine.,1
"Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?",0
"Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!",2
"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.",1
"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?",0
"No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.",2
"Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.",2
"Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?",2
"Yeah, it's all set.",0
"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!",1
"All right, here we go! Jimmy?",2
Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!,2
"That was a sweet idea, Kyle.",0
"God damn it, that wasn't my idea!",1
"Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars.",1
"No, that... I thought that was a lot.",1
You're welcome.,1
Oh crap.,1
"Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?",0
There's a bunch outside my house too.,2
No! Fuck off!,2
"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.",0
He did?,1
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!,2
"Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.",1
You what?!,2
"Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.",1
"Kyle, what were you thinking?",0
"Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!",2
"I don't want you to jump them, retard!",1
"Dude, it's our dads.",0
Oh my God.,1
"You see what you did, Kyle?!",2
"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents.",0
They're everywhere!,2
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.,0
"Holy shit, dude!",1
Over here!  Jump down! Go!,0
"Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.",2
"Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.",2
"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house.",0
Are you the head of Homeless Studies?,0
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-,0
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.,0
"All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.",2
"I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.",2
"Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.",1
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.,2
"You barely made it over one, fatass!",1
"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!",0
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-,1
What's it doing?,1
Cool.,2
What about you?,1
"Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.",2
What the hell happened here?,0
"We, just came to ask a question.",0
We're nine.,1
"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.",0
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.,2
"Shut up, Cartman!",1
Youu heard about that?,2
Thirty was hard enough.,2
"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!",1
"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!",0
"Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.",2
"You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park!",1
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!,1
"But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!",0
"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!",0
"No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.",1
"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!",0
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!,1
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!,1
"All right, I'm turning around",0
"All right, hit it.",1
Let's hope to Christ this works.,2

The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-,2
"Dude, that mom is kewl.",2
Are you talkin' to me?!,2
"What's your problem, kid?!",2
Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?,2
"All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?",2
Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha.,2
I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!,2
Puh- pussy!,2
Pussy! Cock! Shit!,2
"Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls!",2
...Cocksucker!,2
"Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!",2
"But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.",2
"Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot!",2
"Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!",2
"Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there.",1
"Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!",2
"Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?",1
"Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.",2
He's faking.,1
"Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.",2
"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!",1
"...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.",2
Who cares about saying whatever you-?,1
"Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.",2
"Grrhh, whatever.",1
"Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy!",2
Dicktits!,2
Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me.,2
"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.",2
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!,2
Will you knock it off already?!,1
"Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.",2
"Don't push me, asshole!",1
"No! Up yours, fatboy!",1
Kyle please! I'm sorry!,2
"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!",1
"N-no, I'm just saying that I think-",1
"That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!",2
"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.",1
Dude...,1
"Aw, come on!",1
"Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",1
I'm sorry.,1
"Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.",2
"You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?",2
"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh-",1
"Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!",2
Thank you. Big-nosed kike!,2
"Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome?",2
"Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman",2
"Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf!",2
"Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!",2
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!,1
"Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.",2
"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!",1
Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?,2
...Scotch?,1
"Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.",2
"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!",1
"Then the game is on, Kyle.",2
"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice!",1
"Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night.""",2
What did you say?,1
Uhh nuh-nothing...,2
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole!,1
Hm. That was... weird.,2
"Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles.",2
"And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?",2
"No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson!",2
"Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom!",2
"Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?",2
"Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah!",2
I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it!,2
"Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!",2
"No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.",2
Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye!,2
"Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.",2
"My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.",2
No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.,2
But I'm not gonna do the-,2
"I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?",2
"You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.",2
"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye.",2
"Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!",2
"No, I'm just gonna go-",2
How does he do that?,2
"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.",2
"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?",1
You sure you don't wanna back out?,1
"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219.",1
Kyle?,2
"Surprise, fatass!",1
"Kyle, what are you doing?",2
"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.",1
"Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?!",1
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!,2
"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!",2
"No, I- I beat you!",1
"You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye!",2
No way!,0
"No, never.",0
"That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?",0
"Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.",0
"Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.",0
"You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand.",0
"Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?",0
"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.",0
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?,0
"Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.",0
"Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?",0
"All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.",0
Agh!,0
I take it back!,0
You're not number two!,0
What is wrong with that guy?,0
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!,0
So Bono's newest record is a lie!,0
So?,0
He's the record.,0
"Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.",0
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!,0
Dude.,0
"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.",0
"Dad, are you all right?",0
"All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here.",2
"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.",1
"It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?",2
"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out.",2
"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!",1
"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?",2
"Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position!",2
This is fucking retarded!,1
"Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you.",2
"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!",1
"Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!",2
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.,2
"Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!",1
"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!",2
"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!",1
Set off diversion track C!,2
Dude...,0
Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive!,2
Cool.,0
"Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!",2
Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow!,2
Where'd he go?,0
"Kyle, suck my balls.",2
"Dad, where do leprechauns come from?",1
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.,1
I thought I did.,1
"Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?",2
"Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.",2
"Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!",1
"Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.",2
"I'm not doing it, fatass!",1
"We had a deal, Kyle!",2
Just get out of here!,1
"You signed an agreement, Kyle!!",2
I don't care if I signed an agreement!,1
"Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.",2
"That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.",1
"And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!",2
Hey dudes.,1
How was what?,1
"I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!",1
"Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.",0
"Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.",1
...What do you know about the leprechaun?,0
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!,1
Who the hell are you?,0
Dude.,1
"Come on, guys.",0
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!,1
What is this place?,0
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-,0
"STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!",1
Butters.,0
Dude!,1
"A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God.",1
"Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.",1
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?,0
...And then it got attacked by terrorists?,1
Yeah! How'd you know?,0
"Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!",1
Why?,0
What did they say??,1
...Dude...,1
"I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!",2
I...,1
"Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?",1
Yesss!,2
"Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.",2
"Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.",2
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.,2
"What? Move aside, move aside!",2
"Dude, do you really have to do it?",0
Let's just get this over with!,1
"Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.",2
God damnit!,1
Yehehehesss. Yehhhs!,2
Who are you?,1
"Hey, let go of him!",2
"No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE!",2
"Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.",2
"I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls.",2
Previously on Battlestar Galactica,2
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!,1
"Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.",0
We just... went on a balloon ride.,1
"Dude, we don't remember.",0
...What?,1
No.,0
Your what?,0
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?,1
"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?",0
"Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle.""  But then...  ""NO! NOOO!""  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust.",2
NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.,2
That's not very imaginative.,0
Ah I guess.,1
"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.",1
The Imagination song?,0
"No, no dude, it went up there.",1
Imagina-he-hey-,0
Imagina-eh,1
"Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.",0
"Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!",2
"Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!",2
"Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.",0
"Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on""",1
Cartman??,1
"Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!",2
"That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!",2
No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!,2
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!,1
"Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!",1
Stan?,1
"Dude, you did make a deal...",0
Theee conference room is which way?,2
"Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.",2
"I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government!",1
"Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.",2
"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-",1
"Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.",2
"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!",1
"Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second.",2
"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it!",1
"Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...",2
Just get to it already!,1
"Wait, woodland critters...",0
Get them out of there!,0
Tell them to get away now!,0
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?,2
"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!",1
"No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?",2
Let's just DO IT!,1
"In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually-",2
"Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.",2
No! Goddammit no!,2
AAAHHH!,1
KYLE!!,0
AAAAAAAAAAAA-,1
No! Kyle can't die.,2
"NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!",2
Zap him again!  Do it!,2
DO IT!  Come on buddy.,2
"Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy.",2
"Wake up, Kyle.",2
Hello?  Hello? Anybody?,0
Stan?,1
"Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?",2
"Cartman, what's happened?",1
"What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.",2
"No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!",1
"You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see",2
Arh!,1
"Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!",2
"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!",1
"Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?",2
"Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?",1
"Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts.",2
"Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split",2
"Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.",1
Oh for the love of God!,1
Hello? Can anybody hear me?,0
"Stan! Dude, is that you?",1
"Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.",0
"No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.",1
...Oh that makes sense.,0
"Dude, what's happening?",1
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.,0
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?,2
Oh no.,1
...What?,2
Kyle? What's happening?,0
The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.,1
What?! You can't let them do that!,0
What am I supposed to do?,1
"Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!",0
Stan? Stan??,1
Where are you going?!,2
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!,1
"Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.",2
"No, I don't! The decision was overturned.",1
We had a DEAL KYLE!,2
"Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!",1
"IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!",2
"Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.",1
"Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!",1
"No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.",0
"No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.",0
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.,0
The Chosen One?,0
What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!,2
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?,2
"Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?",2
"No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!",2
"Kyle? Kyle, what happened?",0
Nothing.,1
Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do!,1
"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!",0
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!,1
Well you have to convince them they are real!,0
"No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls",1
"Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.",0
Huh?,1
Oh boy...,1
"Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?",1
Aah.,1
"Yeah, I guess.",1
Hi Superman.,1
I know.,1
Oh God...,1
"Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!",2
"Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.",1
You have to stop!,1
"Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us.",1
"So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle.",2
"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!",1
"Dude! How did you do that, Butters?",0
"You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do?",2
"Cartman, don't!",1
"O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls!",2
"O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?",2
I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!,1
"No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.",2
"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls.",2
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!,1
"Stan, you guys are good!",2
"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us!",0
"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.",1
Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!,0
"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.",2
"Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.",0
Real guitars are for old people.,2
"Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time.",0
"Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!",2
"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating.",1
"Dude, we are total rock stars now!",0
Hang on.,0
Yeah?,0
"Yeah, we did.",0
"Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!",0
For reals?,1
That'd be awesome!,0
"Wow, this is a huge party.",0
"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News!",0
"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials.",1
"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!",0
Oh my God!,1
Are you serious??,0
"Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.",0
Do we? He's a legend!,1
"Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.",1
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.,0
"D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?",1
"Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.",0
"Oh, okay. Cool.",1
Really? That'd be sweet.,0
"What, you mean, Kyle?",0
"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.",0
"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?",0
"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""?",0
"Hey dude, how'd it-?",1
"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.",0
"This is um, Thad Jarvis.",0
"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?",1
"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.",0
But it's our game. We bought it together.,1
"I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.",0
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!,1
"Don't put this all on me, Kyle!",0
Oh my God this is so awesome.,2
"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-",0
I have been sick!,1
"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!",0
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points.,1
"Let's just do this, all right?",0
"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.",0
Hero-Heroin Hero?,0
And there's no score? No crowds?,0
"Dude, this is awesome.",0
Ugh. Damint.,0
"Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!",0
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!,0
"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!",0
"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!",0
"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!",0
"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time!",0
Man...,0
"Just, just a little.",0
"I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!",0
No problem.,0
I'm not done yet.,1
No. You're thinking of somebody else.,1
"Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?",1
"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.",1
"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.",1
"Thanks, Mick.",1
"Huh? What, uh?",0
The dragon. Where did it go?,0
"All right, Stan, you've got it, man!",2
Come on guys. Let's get out of here.,2
"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!",0
I just wanna find something else to play.,0
"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?",0
"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?",0
What are you doing here?,1
"Please, ih ih, it won't take long.",0
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five.,1
"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better.",0
"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities!",1
"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.",0
"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship!",1
That isn't it at all.,0
"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore!",1
"I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.",0
"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?",1
"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.",1
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.,0
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!,1
"What, you mean it?",0
"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.",1
"Then let's go, dude!",0
"Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?",1
"Thanks, Mick!",1
"All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell?",0
"Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!",0
"No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!",0
"You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad!",0
"Mom, will you get Dad out of here?",0
"Stop cheating, Craig!",2
"'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!",2
That's it?,0
Goddammit! God dammit!,1
"Butters, you wanna play me next?",2
"Dude, Butters, calm down.",0
They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?,2
"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?",0
"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.",1
"Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.",2
"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!",2
"No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor",2
"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.",2
"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?!",1
"All right, Bebe, let's see the list.",2
"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!",2
"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.",2
Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!,2
"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.",2
"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail""",2
"At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.",2
"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?",2
"Bail, bail!",2
"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.",2
"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.",2
"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention!",2
We got it! We got it!,2
"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door!",2
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.,0
"And then Token, and then me.",0
What?! That's bullcrap!,2
"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?",1
"You're last, dude!",2
Yes way! Check it out!,2
"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.",0
So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!,2
I'm last? Last?,1
"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?",0
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?,1
"Who cares what dumb girls think, right?",0
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.,1
"Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.",1
Oh God! I do?,1
Ahahah!,1
"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!",1
"I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!",2
Hrrgh!,1
"Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?",2
"Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool.",2
Hello.,1
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!,1
"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.",1
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on.,1
Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?,0
Just for a minute. Over here.,0
"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.",0
"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?",0
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.,0
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?,0
"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?",0
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.,1
Who said that?,1
Abraham Lincoln?,1
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.,1
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!,1
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!,1
I have no idea what you're talking about.,0
"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?",0
That should just about do it.,1
What's going on?,0
"Jesus, dude!",0
"Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.",0
"All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!",1
"Kyle! Kyle, don't!",0
"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!",1
"The list was a forgery, Kyle!",0
Huh??,1
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list.,0
"Stan, what is going on?!",1
"It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.",0
So what number was I??,1
Wendy!,0
She's gonna kill us?,1
Wendy!,0
"Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list.",0
"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?",0
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.,1
...Abe Lincoln?,0
"Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh!",0
AHHHHHH.,2
"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!",2
"No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!",2
...Ice cream?,2
Well...you did say free ice cream?,2
Uh. It's over?,2
"Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!",2
"All right, so where's my ice cream?",2
"You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!",2
What's that supposed to mean?!,2
I HAVE AIDS?,2
"""SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!",2
"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!",2
"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!",2
Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!,2
NO! NOOOOOOOO!,2
What's going on? Are we in trouble?,0
...What?,0
Cartman has HIV?,1
Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?,1
...No. Way.,1
"God damn it, this sucks ass!",2
"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute.",1
"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!",2
"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!",2
Where the hell is everybody?,2
So this is it?,2
"Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!",2
Just bring out Elton John already!,2
Jimmy Buffett?!,2
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!,2
"Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!",2
"Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!",2
"Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.",2
"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.",0
"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.",2
"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?",0
"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!",2
"I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.",1
No you don't!,2
I do.,1
"If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!",2
I'm sorry. I gotta go home.,1
"Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!",2
"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.",0
Ironic how?,2
"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...",0
"Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!",2
"Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.",0
"Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!",2
"All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up.",2
"Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.",2
"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.",2
"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.",2
"All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.",2
"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole.",2
Wagh.,1
What? No?!,1
"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch!",1
"Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!",2
"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!",1
"Kyle, what?!",2
What did he do?,0
Why do I have HIV?!,1
"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?",2
What did you do?!,1
Nothing!,2
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?!,1
"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale.",2
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!,1
"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-",2
AAAAAAA!,1
Kyle!,2
Here you go!  Here you go!,1
He gave me AIDS!,1
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!,1
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!,2
Kind of.,2
I'm sorry.,2
An apology?!,1
"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.",2
...What?!,1
A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!,1
See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys.,2
"Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?",2
I'm going to break everything that you own!,1
"What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!",2
"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!",2
"There is no cure, you asshole!",1
"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.",2
What hope?!,1
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.,2
You're lying!,1
"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.",2
Magic Johnson?,1
He was a basketball player.,2
So what?!,1
"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!",2
"You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!",1
My God...,2
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.,2
"Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.",2
"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!",2
"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!",1
NO!,1
"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.",2
"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares!",2
"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.",2
"Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.",2
"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.",2
Don't. Touch me.,1
I know. I'm scared too.,2
"Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.",1
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!,1
"Kyle, we need to try to find a-",2
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!,1
"I don't think it's funny, Kyle.",2
"Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!",1
"Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-",2
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!,1
Are you sure?,2
Yes!!,1
"Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!",2
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?,1
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?,1
You sleep with money. Every night?,1
"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...",1
Wugh.,1
"Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.",2
All right!,2
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!,1
"What?! Aw, no!",2
"What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.",2
I'm still breaking your Xbox.,1
"What? No. No.  Kyle, no!",2
"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?",0
"Yeah, but we totally don't.",2
"Aw dude, that's our town!",2
A hundred thousand dollars?,1
That's enough to buy slaves!,2
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.,1
And she's at a hotel in our town.,0
"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.",1
Sweet!,2
"Butters, don't be such a pussy.",0
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!,1
Oh no.,0
"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!",1
"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole!",2
"We uh, we have special permission?",1
"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.",0
We did it guys!,1
I told you that would work!,0
Ahall right!,1
"All right. Butters, go get next to her.",1
"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?",0
"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!",1
"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.",0
"All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.",2
You do?,0
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.,0
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.,1
Whew.,1
"Oh, thank God.",0
"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?",1
"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.",0
"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable.",1
"Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.",0
"Oh, God, what have we done?!",1
"Yeah, of course.",0
Jesus Christ!,0
"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.",0
"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?",1
"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.",0
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!,0
"No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!",0
"Aw come on now, people!",1
She doesn't have any lips!,0
"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.",0
"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?",1
I know where.,0
We want three tickets to the North Pole.,0
"We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt.",0
"Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.",1
Oh no.,0
"Dude, they're never gonna let us through.",0
Yes they are! I have an idea.,1
"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon.",0
"I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!",1
"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?",1
"You doing okay, Ms. Spears?",0
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!,1
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?,1
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!,1
"Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on!",0
"Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?",1
Be a good boy? You know all about this?,1
"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?",0
"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!",1
Sacrificed? For what?,0
Corn harvest!,1
"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!",0
No wait.,0
You can get high from choking yourself?,1
Cat pee?,2
"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?",0
"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now?",2
You guys are wasting your time.,1
"Yeah, this is not gonna work.",0
"Okay, ready Kenny?",2
"All right, bring out...! The other male cat.",2
Whoa!,1
Do you feel anything?,0
"Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed?",2
"Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!",2
"Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.",2
"Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?",2
"Ah, Kenny!",2
"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!",1
What titties?,0
"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.",1
"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.",0
"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.",1
"Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.",2
"Guys, have you seen Kenny?",1
"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.",0
"Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.",1
"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.",0
"Yeah, who has cats these days?",2
"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.",1
Kenny?,1
"Kenny, you home?",0
Kenny!,1
"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.",1
"Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.",0
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese!,1
"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.",0
We've gotta keep this away from him.,1
"Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine.",2
"All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on.",2
"All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.",1
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.,1
"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?",1
God!,1
Who is it?!,2
"Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal.",2
"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.",2
"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...",2
"What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!",2
"Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.",2
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it!,1
"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.",0
"He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.",2
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.,0
"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!",1
"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand!",2
"Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.",0
"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?",1
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!,1
What the hell is he talking about?,0
I'm sure glad that's over with.,0
"But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong.",2
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?,1
"Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.",2
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.,0
Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life.,1
"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.",2
Kenny!,1
What the hell kind of flowers are those?,0
Kenny? Kenny?!,1
"Oh God, I'm bored already.",2
Gayness!,2
"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.",1
We don't care. *urp*,2
"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!",1
"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!",0
"God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!",0
"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!",2
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!,1
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy.,0
No! NOOO!,2
"Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike.",1
We totally think you should have more money.,1
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.,1
The Internet?,1
What'd they say?,0
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.,1
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?,2
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.,1
Wait. I've got it.,2
There's more people viewing it!,2
This is going great!,0
"Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon!",1
"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.",0
"Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.",2
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.,0
"Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!",2
"Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.",2
Excuse me.  Hello?,1
Wait we're working on it.,1
"Sir, we're doing everything we can.",1
We don't want you to die.,1
"We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?",1
"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.",1
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.,2
"Okay, we did it.",1
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.,0
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you.,1
"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!",0
Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.,1
"...You are a homo, Butters.",2
"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!",1
"Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!",1
"He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!",1
"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?",1
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?,1
Ike. Ike!  It's over.,1
Yeah. Here you go.,1
"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.",0
"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.",1
...Yeah.,0
"Dude, wanna do some math problems?",0
"Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.",2
Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!,2
Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.,2
Yes!,2
"You're not the teacher, fatass.",1
"That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde.",2
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!,2
"Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.",2
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?,2
"Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.",2
You're not an awesome teacher!,1
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.,2
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!,1
"Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?",2
Kenny's!,1
"Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.",2
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you!,1
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.,2
Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.,2
I am here... to teach you calculuuus.,2
"Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.",2
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge,2
"How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.",2
"No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.",2
"Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?",2
"Nice form, compadre.",2
"Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us?",2
"Okay, you start on defense, amigo.",2
"Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!",2
"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo.",2
"Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing.",2
"Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?",2
"Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can-",2
"Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me.",2
Good. Again.,2
Again!,2
Now you sound like white people!,2
The answer to #27 is 5.,2
The answer to #28 is 14.,2
"All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?",2
"How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.",2
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?,2
"Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.",2
"Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.",2
Uh what?,2
"Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.",2
"How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.",2
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.,2
I reeached these keeeds.,2
"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things",0
Aw man!,0
What the hell?,0
My Internet's not working either.,0
I'm getting on it first.,0
"Kyle, I need to use your Internet",0
Ih it's not working.,1
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.,1
I have to get online before school.,1
What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.,0
It's not working here?,1
"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!",0
What's so funny about that?,0
"Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee.",0
All right!,0
Where... is... the Internet?,1
Eight fifty one.,0
Hey! Mom!,0
"Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...",1
I think... I know what's wrong.,1
It's gotta be our turn soon.,0
Dad?,0
Ughh.,0
This is gonna suck.,1
"Let's be partners, Kenny.",2
"Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude.",2
"Naw, I'm with Wendy.",0
"Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.",2
"I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?",1
"Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?",2
God damn it!,2
That isn't necessary!,2
"You can let go now, Butters.",2
"Butters, come on!",2
"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.",0
That guy is wearing a digital watch.,1
I wanna shoot an Indian.,2
"Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  ""Super... Phun Thyme.""  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!",2
"Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!",2
"Fine, then let go of my hand!",2
"Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!",2
"Fine, then you're comin' with me!",2
"Butters, let go God-damn it!",2
Right. Except for it really isn't.,1
What's that?,1
Sounds like police sirens.,0
I don't know.,0
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?,0
"Come on, this is serious!",1
"Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!",0
This is not the time for that!,0
"Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!",2
"All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.",2
"Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?",2
"Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars!",2
Here! Here's the phone!,1
What's the number to dial out?,1
"Dude, do you understand what's going on here?!",0
"I got through. Hello, police?",1
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!,1
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.,1
"Sister, you don't know the half of it.",1
"Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!",2
"Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice.",2
"Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!",2
"Yeheah, we're wired up!",2
"Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet!",2
"Aw, just a few more things.",2
"Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on.",2
Why aren't the cops coming in?,1
Will you shut up!,1
"Wait, you have guns here?",0
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!,0
"Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.",2
"Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.",2
"Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.",2
They must have realized we left. Damn.,2
Shhh! Butters!,2
"Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!",2
"Butters, l-listen to me, listen.",2
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.,2
"If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.",2
Butters?,2
"All right, come on!",2
"Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.",2
"Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.",2
"It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.",2
Save me!,2
"... Oh dude, laaame.",2
"Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!",2
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!,2
Ready? Go!,2
"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!",1
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice.,0
"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away.",0
"Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..",0
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.,0
"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.",0
"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?",0
"Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?",2
"Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.",2
"Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.",2
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.,2
Jesus Christ!,2
AAAAH!,2
"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?",0
He done killed yer pahr.,0
"No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!",2
They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!,2
"Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.",2
They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.,2
"All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?",2
"I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this.",1
"Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?",0
"Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore!",1
"Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.",0
"Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.",1
"Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.",0
"Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!",1
"There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.",0
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!,1
How?,0
"I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.",1
"You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.",0
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can.,1
God damn it.,0
"There you are, Butters!",2
"Butters, I need your help.",2
"The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!",2
"I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.",2
"You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!",2
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?,2
So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!,2
"You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.",2
No... No!  No...,1
"No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!",1
Let's get out of here!,0
We can't just leave!,1
Come on!,0
Aw it's horrible!,1
Somebody do something!,1
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him!,1
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle!,0
Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!,1
COME ON LET'S GO!,0
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!,1
JUST RUN!!,0
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!,0
"Let's just go, Let's just go!",0
NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...,1
"All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?",2
"This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans.",2
"Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot.  ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong.",2
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!,2
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!,2
"Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.",2
Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?,2
"Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.",2
"They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.",2
"So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.",2
Ting ton teetong.,2
"Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot.",2
"Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.",0
"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.",0
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were!,0
Indiana Jones! All right!,0
"You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!",0
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?!,0
Indy!,0
"No, stop! Raape!",0
"All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!",2
"Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.",2
What day is American invasion again? I fohget.,2
"...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.",2
Oh my God...,2
"Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them.",2
Hold the gun on them Butters!,2
"They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!",2
"Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!",2
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!,2
"Shoot him, Butters!",2
"You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!",2
"Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.",2
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.,2
"It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.",2
"My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.",1
"I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.",1
You aren't alone.,0
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.,0
I love you too.,1
Wh-why?,0
Did you see it?,1
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!,0
Indy deserved more than that!,1
"Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe!",2
"No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!",2
"One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!",2
"No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters!",2
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!,2
"God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!",2
"What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!",2
...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!,2
But they raped Indiana Jones!,0
"I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.",1
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore.,1
"No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!",2
Good! Did you kill him?,2
"Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it.",2
"You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.",2
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.,2
"So, what now?",0
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.,1
"I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it.",2
She said it again.,2
"Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?",2
"Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!",2
"I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.",2
"Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!",2
"Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!""",2
"Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""",2
"Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?",2
"Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?",2
"You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.",2
Whassup?  Whassup?,2
"Standing right here, let's go, bitch.",2
You're gonna fight me after school?,2
"You're a chick, dude.",2
"Oh, it's on, bitch!",2
"She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.",2
"Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass.",2
"Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?",2
"Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-",2
"I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.",2
"Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.",2
"Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.",2
"Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.",2
"Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.",2
I guess so.,0
What am I supposed to do about it?,0
Wendy. Wendy psst.,2
"Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.",2
"Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-",2
"Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.",2
My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.,2
Eat my underwear?,2
"Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.",2
"No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.",2
"I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.",2
"I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am...",2
Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.,2
So...  are we cool?,2
I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-,2
"Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?",2
"Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.",2
"You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.",2
"Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.",2
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you.,0
"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.",2
Really?,0
"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.",2
"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.",0
"God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head!",2
Detention! That's it!,2
"Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that?",2
"Ahhh, sweet.",2
What?! That's ridiculous!,2
That's not why I did it.,2
"Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.",2
"Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.",2
Huh?,2
"The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up.",2
"The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool.",2
Okay Mommy. Mamamama.,2
"Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.",2
"What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.",2
Why not? You chicken?,2
"Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!",2
"I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.",2
Told you guys.,2
"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.",0
"Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary.",2
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?,2
"Wendy, Wendy.",2
"Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!",2
"Butters, get out of here!",2
...Huh?,2
"What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.",2
"Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.",2
"All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!",2
You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool.,2
"Dude, we never thought you were cool.",0
That's not true. You're just saying that.,2
"No, really. We've always thought you suck.",1
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.,2
"Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool.",2
"If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay!",2
"I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?",1
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?,2
Girls like shaved balls?,1
What girl is gonna see your balls?,2
"Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?",0
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.,2
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!,0
I think Kenny likes it.,1
I gotta get home for dinner.,0
"Yeah, me too.",2
God!,0
Shut up already!,2
I'm outta here; see ya guys.,0
They're in London too?,0
Where's dad?,0
Oh Jesus Christ!,0
"I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny.",2
"You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.",0
So?,2
"So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?",0
How much?,2
Over two hundred bucks.,0
Two hundred dollars?,1
Really? Are you sure?,2
"Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that!",0
...Become a Peruvian flute band?,1
"Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.",0
Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.,2
Yeah!,0
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments?,1
"Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?",2
"Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?",2
"Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars?",0
"Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.",2
"Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!",1
All right Craig!,2
"There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.",0
"And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.",2
"Craig, don't be an asshole.",2
"All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!",0
"And a one, and a two, and a-",2
"Por favor, buy our CDs de musica.",2
Gracias.,1
This is awesome!,1
"Ya see, Craig?",0
Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey!,2
"Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first.",0
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!,2
"This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?!",0
God damn it!,1
No! No es bueno!,2
"No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!",2
"Ha!  Serves you right, assholes!",2
"Hey, back off!",0
"Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?",0
"Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?",1
"No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-",0
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!,1
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.,0
"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.",0
"We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.",0
We just wanna go home.,1
"Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.",1
We we speak English!,0
And we're White.,2
"You're being extremely negative, Craig.",2
Help you how?,0
"No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru!",1
"Kyle, calm down.",0
"You know I can't go there, Stan!",1
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic.,0
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?,1
"Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.",0
There's no talking to this guy.,2
"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?",0
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?,1
"Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.",1
"We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!",0
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?,1
Guinea pigs?,0
"Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.",0
And that makes sense to you?,1
"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!",0
So we've gotta find another way out of here.,1
"You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.",2
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.,2
"Dude, what is this place?",0
"Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!",0
Yeah. Stuff just happens.,1
That's right!,1
That's right.,2
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.,1
"Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way.",2
"Hey, hey, look at this.",1
What is it?,2
I don't know. It's old.,1
Let's see what's in there.,0
"It might be a way out, Craig!",0
"Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants!",2
"Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries",1
"You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings.",0
"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.",1
"I know, a-and look.",0
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?,2
"Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened.",1
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then...,0
"Dude, it's Craig!",2
That is Craig.,1
"Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?",0
"Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?",2
"Let's head over this way, guys.",0
Hear that? It sounds like water.,1
"Yeah, it's coming from up there.",2
Wow.,0
"Dude, that's awesome.",2
"All right, let's go.",0
"Wait, whattaya mean no?",0
"Dude, we we have to go check this out.",0
"'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.",0
"Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!",0
How do you do that?,1
"Craig, dude, wait up.",0
"Dude, Craig, we should go back now.",2
"Hey look, there's something here.",0
"Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.",2
"Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!",2
"No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.",0
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.,1
That guy's an asshole!,2
"Yeah, what a dick!",1
"Dude, have you seen my parents?",1
"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?",0
"He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.",1
"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint.",0
Jesus Christ...,0
"Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV?",2
"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.",1
"Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.",0
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!,0
Oh my God!,1
"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.",1
Ike?  Oh crap Ike?,1
"Dad Dad, we have a problem.",0
"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.",0
"Dude, he's wasted.",0
"Dad, what are you doing?!",0
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window.,1
"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.",1
"Hey, there's some people.",0
"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.",1
"Let go of my face, asshole!",0
"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!",1
We NEED a ride to the hospital!,1
"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay.",1
"E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.",1
Why does that matter?,0
"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.",1
So where's the other doctor?,0
What the hell?  Ike?,1
"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.",0
"Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude.",2
What's High School Musical 3?,1
What's High School Musical 1 and 2?,0
There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!,2
What the hell are they doing?,2
I have no idea.,0
"Dude, girls are such fags.",2
Who the hell is that?,0
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?,1
"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...",0
"This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys.",2
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.,0
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.,1
"Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.",2
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.",0
I'm not doing it either. Kenny?,1
"All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.",0
I swear,1
"Okay, good.",0
Ehhhhhhh.,2
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.,1
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.,2
But you didn't die?,0
"...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore.",2
Aw man.,1
God this sucks!,2
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.,0
Stop.,0
"Uh, Wendy?",0
"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.",0
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.",0
It is?,0
"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!",0
"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.",0
"Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.",0
"Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.",0
"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.",0
You don't like doing it?,0
Basketball?,0
"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!",0
"Yes, you can. What's stopping you?",0
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!",0
"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.",0
Sweet.,0
"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.",2
"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.",1
"Fuck you, Kyle!",2
Aww!,0
"Oh God, shut up!",2
Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!,2
"Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!",0
"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.",0
"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.",0
"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!",0
"Ah, shit.",0
"Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.",2
"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.",0
What? Are you crazy?,1
No way dude.,2
"We promised each other we would never do that, remember?",1
"I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.",0
"Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.""",2
"""Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson.""",2
"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?",0
"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.",1
"That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids",0
"""That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.""",2
"God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now?

"Well, I had to see it to believe it!",1
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.,2
"Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.",0
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!,1
"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!",0
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!,1
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!,0
"You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.",2
"Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.",0
"That's a low blow, Stan.",2
"That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball",0
But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.,2
"Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.",0
"Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am.",1
"And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta-",2
"Do what you want, don't have restraint.",1
Don't stress about it or you just might faint.,2
Try to do what you wanna do!,0
involves needing scissors and glue!,0
Huh?,0
Where did everybody go?,1
But the girls like singing and dancing.,0
"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.",0
"Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere.",2
"Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan?",1
"No, I'm on the Japanese side.",0
"Oh, who just shot me?",2
"U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.",2
"Dude, what?",0
"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!",0
"Butters, there's no such things as vampires.",1
"All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.",2
"Yeah, now get out of here.",2
"Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!",2
Butters?  Butters?!,2
"Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!",2
Dude!,2
"Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!",2
Yes.,2
"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?",2
"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.",0
"Yeah, it's just so astounding.",1
"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.",2
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.,1
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.,2
"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.",0
"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.",1
"Butters, what's the problem?",2
"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!",2
"All right, come on, guys.",0
"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny!",0
"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.",0
"Oh, boy.",0
"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...",1
"W-well, we've heard that she's...",1
Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.,2
"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.",2
He took it pretty well.,2
"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you?",2
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?,1
A B.J.?,0
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?,1
Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!,2
"Yeah, dude, that's gross.",0
What kind of protection?,1
"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?",1
"Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?",2
"Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.",2
So how did it go last night?,0
Purity ring?,2
"...Well, what does that mean?",1
"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-",0
"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.",1
"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.",1
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.,0
"Yup, he's in here.",1
"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!",0
"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!",1
Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!,2
"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.",0
"Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?",2
"You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?",0
"You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.",0
"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.",1
"Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!",2
What?,0
"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this!",2
"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!",1
"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die!",0
"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you.",1
Excuse us. Excuse us.,0
"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!",2
"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!",0
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!,1
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh,2
Cartman?,1
"Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa?",0
Dow...,1
We... don't work for any-body.,0
The hell did you do to us?!,2
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.,0
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.,1
"I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.",2
"Well, now we know.",1
And knowing is half the battle.,2
"The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact.",2
Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.,2
Who's the Coon?,0
"I know, right?  ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.",2
"...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.",1
"You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!",2
"...Dude, what?!",1
He's not a fag!,2
Why do you care?,1
"Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?",2
"And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.",2
"Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.",2
Hunh!,2
"I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!",2
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!,2
"Wha, what?",2
Fuckin' butthole!,2
You gotta be kidding me!,2
AAAAAHT!!,2
"So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!",2
Not really.,0
Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?!,2
"Dude, what the hell?",0
"Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!",2
"Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.",0
What?! Why?,2
"It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!",2
Fucking bitch...,2
"Whoa, what the?",1
"Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.",1
"Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.",1
Who? Me? Why?,1
"Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!",2
"Do I really have to do this, Dad?",0
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.,0
"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.",0
"Uh, what?",0
What's all gone?,0
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.,0
"Well, what can I do to get back my money-?",0
I just opened an account.,0
"No, you just lost it all!",0
Hey!,0
Dad?!,0
"Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?",0
"Yeah, I think I get it.",0
"And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...",2
"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.",0
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?,0
Well this sucks!,1
"Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!",2
"You want something new every week, fatass.",1
"Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!",2
My fault?,1
"The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!",2
"Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!",1
"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?",1
"Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.",2
"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family",1
I wanna return this Margaritaville.,0
"No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.",0
Wall Street?,0
"I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand.",2
What's that?,1
What?,1
What did he do?,1
"Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!",1
"Come on, this is ridiculous!",1
"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel.",1
"'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?",0
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.,0
It does?,0
So I can return it to a bank?,0
Aargh!,0
"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.",1
"Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.",2
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!,0
Nnnaaargh!,0
Really?  Thank you.,0
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.,1
"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me.",1
"All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.",2
"Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.",1
"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now.",1
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!,0
"No, dude, that doesn't make sense!",0
"It's okay, Ma.",1
Heunh.,1
"Aww, come on!",1
"Oh man, I thought that day would never end.",2
"What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!",0
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!,2
"No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny.",2
"Come on guys, we gotta go!",1
Let's get to my house!!,2
Oh boy!,0
"Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.",2
"It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor!",2
What the fuck is this?!,2
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!,2
"No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!",2
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!,0
"You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!",2
Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?!,2
"You tell 'em, Cartman!",0
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!,1
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy!,2
"And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...",2
Robbed us of our innocence.,1
"Yes, that's good.",2
"Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.",0
"It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?",0
"Mom, gross!",0
"Stop it, Mom!",0
I'm going too.,0
"Yeah it's different, Mom!",0
"Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?",2
"We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.",2
"Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.",0
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.,1
"You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.",2
"Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.",2
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.,0
"Sick! Stop it, lady!",2
No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!,0
"Mom, we didn't mean...",0
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.,0
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.,2
"Hey Jimmy, what are you up to?",2
"Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.",2
"Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.",2
"No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.",2
"No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else.",2
Meh.,2
"Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?",2
"Yeah, I like fishsticks.",2
"What, dude, you got something?",2
Yeah.,2
"Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.",2
"Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.",2
"Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?",2
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?,2
"What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?",2
"Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?",2
Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?,2
What are you?,2
"And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.",2
"We know, Cartman!",1
"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.",2
"Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.",2
"Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us!",2
"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?",1
"Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.",1
"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!",1
"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!",1
"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!""",1
Motherfucker!,2
"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!",2
"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!",2
"But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!",2
"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?",2
"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?",2
"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.",2
"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow!",2
"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.",2
"It's cool man, it's cool.",2
"Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?",2
"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.",1
"It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it.",2
"You know what, Cartman? I believe you.",1
You do?,2
"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags!",1
"But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?",2
"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?",2
That's cool. You wanna write some together?,2
"Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks",2
"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""",2
"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?""",2
"It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all!",2
Thanks you guys!,2
"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.",2
"Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.",2
"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.",2
Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important.,2
"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.",2
Uhhh excuse me?,2
"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.",2
"Yeah, that was kewl huh?",2
Whassat?,2
So... here it is.,2
"That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!",2
"Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!",2
"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!",2
Hello Jim.,2
What are you up to?,2
"Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up.",2
"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.",2
"Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?""",2
"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off!",2
"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There!",2
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.,2
"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.",2
"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.",2
"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.",2
"I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.",2
"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?",0
"Oh no, he didn't.",0
Tells?,0
"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-",0
"It's uh, Marsh.",0
Yes I do.,0
"Aw crap, Dad!",0
Alien?,0
What does it want?,0
Dad they aren't here for that.,0
"Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.",0
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.,0
"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.",0
"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.",0
Kill the alien?,0
"No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.",0
Dad?,0
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.,0
"No, Dad-",0
"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?",0
"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy!",0
"The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit.",0
"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow.",0
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!,2
"What are you talking about, dude?",0
"Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.",2
"North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.",2
"I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.",2
"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.",1
"Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.",2
"No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.",1
"Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.",2
"Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.",1
Then why don't you wanna go?,2
"Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...",1
"That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning!",2
Please. Please let him go.,1
"Avast there, mateys!  Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life?  Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time?  Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr!  Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends!  Even Kyle said so.  Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!",2
"There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!",2
"Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?",2
"But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.",2
"Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!",2
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!,2
"Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?",2
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits!,2
"Kevin, Goddammit!",2
"We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!",2
"That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.",2
"You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?",2
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!,2
"Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?",2
"The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.",2
"Ah, nice. Come on, mateys!",2
"Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you.",2
"Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.",2
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with,2
"Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.",2
"Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads.",2
"This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!",2
"Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.",2
"Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!",2
"Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!",2
"Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder!",2
Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!,2
"Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!",2
"Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?",1
"No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.",0
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!,1
You really think he'll die in Somalia?,0
"Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.",1
I'll call you back.,1
What? Are you sure?,1
"""Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!",1
Oh God. What have I done?,1
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!,2
"Alright, let's go!",2
"Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!",2
"Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!",2
"I said, get off my boat!",2
"That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs!  Lower 'em down, Ike.",2
"Hard to port, lads!",2
"Just make the boat go that way, kind of.  That's good. Now bring her around portside.  Now that's a pirate ship!  A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves?  Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around.  A round of grog for me boys!  A round of grog for everyone!  The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates!  Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy!  Look at this guy for Christ's sake!  I mean, how hard is this, people?!   I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please! We get all that we want for free!",2
Goddamnit people! With a yo ho ho!,2
And with a yee hee hee!,2
"We take to the African sea!
We'll brave the squalls and bust your balls
Somalian pirates we!",2
Nice. And with a yo ho ho!,2
And a tricky lahty do!,2
"Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a ""lahty do"" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the ""lahty"" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second ""yo ho"". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike?",2
Better! With a yo ho ho!,2
And a tricky lahty do,2
Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.,2
"What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?",2
"Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!",2
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.,2
"No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.",1
"""It isn't safe."" That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was ""awesome.""",2
I know! I was lying then!,1
"Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.",2
"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!",1
"Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.",2
"Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!",2
"Cartman, knock it off!",1
"That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!",2
Clyde!,2
"You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!",2
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!,1
"Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!",2
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever!,2
The FUCK?!,2
"Ike! Ike, what?!",1
"'Sup, Jew?",2
"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.",1
HA! What a dumbass!,2
"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again.",1
"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!",2
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?,2
"Dude, I don't even know who that is.",0
"The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!",2
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.,2
What?! Are you serious?!,1
"Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.",2
"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!",1
"Because he was a great person, Kyle.",2
"NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!",1
"...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...",2
What was what?,1
Are you guys fucking serious?,0
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.,1
"It's all just in your head, Ike.",1
I just... don't understand it.,1
"It's gonna be alright, Kyle.",0
"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?",1
"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.",2
"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?",1
"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.",0
"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.",2
"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?",0
Purgatory? What's that?,1
Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...,2
Billy Mays!  It's him!,2
"Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!",2
Uh oh.,0
"Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.",1
"Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.",1
"You're dead, Mr. Jackson!",0
Accept it!,0
"Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.",1
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!,1
Comoe back here!,1
Hey! Heeey!,1
"Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!",0
"Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!",1
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!,2
What the hell are we going to do??,1
"Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...",0
"Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?",1
Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.,2
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?,1
"Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry.",2
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?,1
"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?",1
"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole!",2
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.,0
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?,1
A child... and a female. And white.,2
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.,0
"Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants?",1
"Go on by, Michael.",1
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!,2
Yeahhhh!,0
God I hope this works.,2
"Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.",0
"Dude, the two male judges love her.",0
Aww crap!,1
"Hey, what the F?!",2
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!,1
"Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.",0
"Aw dide, this is hopeless!",1
"Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.",2
"So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.",2
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?,2
What if you didn't have to give it up?,2
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.,2
Woohoo!,0
Good job Ike!,2
"Ike!  Ike, you're back!",1
"It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.",1
"Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.",2
"Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.""",2
"Alright, your turn Craig.",2
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.,2
"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!",0
"Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl",2
So what?,1
"Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.",2
"Butters, I think you should reconsider this.",1
"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.",1
"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?",2
Atta boy Butters!,2
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.,1
"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.",0
"Butters, you're the one doing all this?",0
"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?",2
"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp!",1
Butters. Dude!,0
You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!,0
"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!",0
"Dude, we've created a monster.",2
"Butters, I really think we should talk.",1
"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.",1
"Butters, what's happened to you?",1
"Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!",2
I'm having the best time!,0
"Oh, sweet!",2
This is awesome!,2
Dude! That was so badass!,2
Wrestling is awesome!,1
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class!,0
The fuck is this?!,2
Why did they have us put on long underwear.,0
"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.",1
"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?",1
I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!,2
Cool!,1
The Rad Russian.,2
"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!",2
Okay...,2
Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!,2
"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!",2
"Yeah, what are you? A child molester?",0
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!,1
"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys.",2
"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.",0
"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap.",2
"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.",2
"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.",2
"Alright are you ready to try this, guys?",2
Yup.,0
"Alright, let's start wrestlin'.",2
"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw!",2
"Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!",2
"Wait for it, wait for the whore line.",2
We'll see about that!,0
"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!",1
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!,0
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!,2
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.,0
"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!",1
"I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!",2
"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!",1
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!,0
"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?",1
"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.",2
"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!",0
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it.,2
"Irene, no! Why?",1
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.,2
"Irene, you said you loved me!",0
"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?!",2
"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.",0
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.,1
"Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?",2
Let's do this! One! Two!,1
"Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.",2
"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!",0
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.,1
"You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!",2
What dude?,1
We just received a letter from the WWE.,2
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?,0
"""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.""",2
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?,0
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers.,1
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..,0
Oh my God... Oh my God...,1
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!,1
"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.",2
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!,0
"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone.",1
"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you.",0
"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!",1
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam.,0
"Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.",2
"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.",1
"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.",2
"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.",2
"Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.",2
What are you talking about?,1
"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!",2
He's right.,0
"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.",0
Right?,2
"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.",0
"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.",1
"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.",2
"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!",2
So what do we do?,1
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.,2
"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.",0
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?,1
It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.,2
"Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!",2
"Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!",2
Thank you.,2
That guy's a pretty good wrestler.,1
"Yeah yeah, not bad.",0
"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?",2
"Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.",0
"Yeah, this guy crushes.",2
He's here! Vince McMahon is here!,1
"He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-",0
"Alright, places everyone.",2
Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown.,2
"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?",0
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.,1
"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?",0
Wait a minute. Who is that?,1
"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene.",0
"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!",1
My man can do whatever he wants.,2
You're just gonna have to deal with that.,2
"My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.",2
"No, you can't possibly mean that-!",0
"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!",2
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!,2
"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.",0
"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!",2
"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!",0
"Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!",2
"Hey, what about us? Our show?",2
"This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!",2

Kenny! I'm-,2
Wow cool.,0
"Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.",0
What the hell is that?,0
"Dad, why did they do that?",0
"Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face.

"Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.",0
What do you mean? This song is sweet.,2
"No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.",0
"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.",1
"So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?",0
"What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.",1
"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!",0
"I'm not too busy, Stan.",2
You're not?,0
"No, I just don't care. At all.",2
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?,0
"Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!",2
"You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit!",0
"I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.",2
"Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?",0
Really?  People who are doing something?,0
Then that's where I belong.,0
Sweet!,0
Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!,0
"Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.",0
"Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!",0
"Wait, that's it?",0
"Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.",0
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!,0
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!,0
What you assholes acted like you were doing?,0
Wait for it... wait for it... NOW!,0
"No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.",0
"...No, I don't care about the show.",0
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls,0
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!,0
"Screw this, I gotta get back to work!",0
Would you mind stepping back a little?,0
"No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.",0
"Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .",2
"Oh no, no, NO.",0
What dude?,2
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?,0
We always have.,2
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!,0
That's not what we said.,2
"You said ""Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!""",0
We were talking about Wales the country.,2
"Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!",0
Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.,2
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!,0
"All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys!",2
"As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt!",0
"Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!",0
"What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.",0
"Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!",2
Screw this! Turn hard to port!,0
"Dude, fuck you!",0
"Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.",2
"Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.",2
What was that?,0
It's like... they know.,0
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.,0
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese.,2
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!,0
"I, I can't, I can't believe it.",0
"Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.",2
"Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.",2
Will you stop that?,0
"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!",2
"Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!",0
"You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.",2
You speak English.,0
"Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?",2
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!,0
Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.,2
"Ummm, where did you get that picture?",0
So that's what this has all been about?,2
"Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-",0
"Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.",2
"Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?",0
Hello? Stan?,1
"Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.",0
"Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.",0
"Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?",2
"Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.",0
This... is exactly what I needed.,1
Aww! Not those guys again!,0
"God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?!",2
God! Shut up!,0
"Piss off, you stupid assholes!",2
"Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.",2
"You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?",2
"No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags.",2
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.,1
But Cartman isn't letting up on him.,2
"Oh, what the hell?!",1
God damn it God damn it!,0
"All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.",0
Agreed.,2
"Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.",0
Sounds good.,1
"Ni-nice, okay.",2
"...That makes perfect sense, Butters.",0
"Yes, now get out of here.",0
"Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?",0
"I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.",2
Oh that's good.,0
"Yeah, I think that'll be nice.",2
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?,0
"I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.",2
"Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!",0
"Really nice work, guys.",0
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.,1
That was us!,2
"Yeah, we did that!",0
"W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.",1
"Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?",2
Gay people?,0
We aren't talking about gay people.,1
"Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?",0
"Oh, they think we meant gay fags.",2
"Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.",1
Aw crap!,0
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.,1
"Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.",0
"Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?",0
Then you're not a fag.,0
"Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?",2
I don't know.,0
"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?",0
"Right. But you're not thinkin' ""Oh, he's a homosexual,"" you're thinkin' ""Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider.""",0
"You call them ""bike-curious"".",2
"""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!",0
"Oh yeah, nice, Kenny.",2
"Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.",0
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.,1
Aw crap!,0
"We're sorry, Mayor.",1
We can fix this!,0
"That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.",0
"Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.",2
"Emmanuel Lewis, huh?",2
"Ohh, it all makes sense now.",0
There's fags everywhere!,0
We gotta run!,1
"Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags.",0
Yeah. You definitely made your point.,1
"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.",0
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.,0
I don't either.,1
No! That'll just make you bigger fags!,2
"...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.",0
We did it! Yeah!,0
"Yeah! We did it, you guys!",1
"Oh it's over, it's finally over!",2
"Today, we've made history.",0
Oh. My. Goodddd.,2
"Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?",2
He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?,2
"Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?",2
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?,2
"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.",2
"But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!",2
Will somebody shut him up?,1
"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?",2
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!,2
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!,2
"You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!",2
"Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!",2
"Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.""  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.",2
"- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -",2
"Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.",2
"Oh God, no!",1
"Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.",2
"I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.",2
"""Thank you"" and this is to..?",2
"""To Douglas."" There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.",2
Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?,2
"Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.",2
That'll be five dollars.,2
What the hell do you think you're doing?!,0
A book signing.,2
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!,0
I do not directly say she's a slut!,2
"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!",0
"You didn't read the rest, dude.",2
"""Or does she?""",0
"""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!",2
"Hey hey, stop reading that!",0
"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!",0
"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?",0
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.,0
"You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?",2
"Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?",2
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!,2
"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!",2
"Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back!",2
"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own.",2
"The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.",2
"""These, are the morning announcements.""",1
"Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.",2
"And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?",2
"Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.",2
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.,2
Of course. That's why we're here.,2
"Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.",2
"Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.",2
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth?,2
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.,2
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?,2
"If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream?",2
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?,2
"Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?",2
What? What do you mean I know that?,2
No! You wiped them all out!,2
"Wait, hold on, can we take a break?",2
"Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-",2
"No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!",2
You sold the movie rights to who?!,2
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!,2
Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else!,2
Huh!,2
"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?",0
"No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!",2
"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.",1
I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded!,2
I'm doin' the best I can!,2
"We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.",2
"Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now.",0
"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.",2
"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.",2
"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.",2
We're here! It's the water park!,0
"Come on, let's go!",2
"We got it, Dad.",0
Six adorable children please.,2
"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?!",2
"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?",1
"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?",0
Forget it! Just forget it!,2
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?,1
"Okay, go ahead.",1
"I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?",1
Okay.,0
"All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!",1
"Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.",0
"No dude, Butters' pee is in there.",1
"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.",0
No they don't!,1
"Yeah, they do, Kyle.",0
"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.",0
"What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!",2
Just do it in English!,2
"There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).",2
"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?",0
I'm not getting back in the water.,1
"Aw come on, Kyle.",0
"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?",1
Not everybody pees in pools.,0
Do you pee in the pool?,1
Not today... yet.,0
"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?",0
Most likely.,1
"You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!",2
"Dude, where have you been?",0
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!,2
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!,2
"Well then they're not minorities, are they?",1
...What do you mean?,2
"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!",1
The black and brown people.,2
"No, you're the minority!",1
"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!",2
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.,0
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!,2
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!,2
I'm gonna go on the slides.,0
"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?",2
"Blow it out your ass, Cartman!",1
Eewww!,1
"This is sweet, huh Kenny?",0
Aaaaah! Gross!,1
"Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!",0
"Aw, sick!",1
Aahhh...,1
"Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!",0
No way!,1
"Dude, that's all pee!",1
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!,0
I'll die if I do swim in it!,1
"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!",0
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!,1
"...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.",0
"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.",0
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!,1
Not... all the time.,0
That is gross!!,1
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!,0
"Kyle, come on!",0
"Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh,",1
Help! Help!,2
"Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh.",2
"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.",2
"Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor.",2
"Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?",1
"Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!",1
Not in pee!,1
Oh who pees in the shower?,1
"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.",0
"You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!",1
Jesus Christ!,1
"It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo...",2
"I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.",2
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.,2
Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.,2
"Well, I do just as much work.",2
Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.,2
Noooo...,2
"NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT!",2
Why?!,1
"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?",0
"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!",1
"Just drink the pee, Kyle.",0
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.,1
"Come on, dude!",0
I'm thinking about it!,1
"Gah, ah.  Gaagh.",1
Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH!,1
"All right, they finally came for us.",0
Are you fucking kidding me?!,1
Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!,2
"Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?",2
"That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!",1
"It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!",2
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!,1
"Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.",0
"Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!",1
What the hell for?!,1
AAAAAAAA!,1
"Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny!",2
What are you guys doing?,0
"Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox.",2
"Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash!",2
"Oh dude, was that a combo move?",2
"Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.",2
"Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.",1
"Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.",2
"Jesus, dude.",1
"I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?",1
"Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?",1
So what happens to us now?,1
"Oh God, it's true.",1
"Butters! Butters, stop it!",1
"Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!",1
"No! Butters, stop!",1
"Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!",1
"Aw dude, I clocked you!",0
"I told you this game was sweet, dude.",2
"Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron.",0
"Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?",2
Hit A and X together.,0
"Oh, you're going down, Elin!",2
"I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.",0
Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?,2
"Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.",1
"Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions.",1
"Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease.",1
"Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??",2
"Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.",0
"Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?",1
...As soon as what's dead?,1
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.,1
What bastard?,1
I guess it... feels great. Thanks.,1
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!,2
"Yeah, where's all the fighting?",0
"Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!",2
"Yeah, golf is stupid again.",0
"Aww, books? God, I hate those!",2
Oh really? Sweet.,2
"Oho man, I can't wait!",2
"No on, come on, let's read it now!",2
"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?",1
"Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!",2
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?,0
"No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.",1
"I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times.",0
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing.,1
"Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!""",2
Why the hell was this book banned?!,1
"They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity!",2
"We know, we were just saying that.",2
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?,0
"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.",1
"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!",2
"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book.",0
"Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.",2
"Yeah, sweet.",1
The Tale of...,1
The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.,2
"Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...",1
It was a... a warm spring morning.,2
"Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!",2
"Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!",0
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.,2
"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!",0
"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!",1
"And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!",2
"Well dude, somebody has got to go down!",0
"Butters, what are you up to?",2
"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!",0
"Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.",2
"Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!",2
"Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters.",0
"Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!",0
"Yeah, we wrote that!",1
"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.",1
What? Hey!,0
"Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!",2
"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!",1
"Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole!",0
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!,2
God-damnit!,0
"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-",1
That inconsiderate jerk!,2
"More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!",0
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!,2
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!,1
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!,0
Yes!,1
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!,2
"What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!",0
There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!,0
I can't believe they won't ban our book!,0
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!,1
"All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.",2
What?!,1
"Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.",2
"Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker!",1
"Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.",2
"Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one.",0
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.,2
"Ms. Jessica Parker, over here.",2
See any hunters yet?,2
"Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.",2
"Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!",1
Butters wrote a second book!,1
So what?,2
"So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!",0
We can get people to believe us now!,1
"Oh dude, sweet!",2
"Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought.",0
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!,2
You can't be serious! You people like this?!,0
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!,1
Oh come on!,2
"God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!",0
"Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.",2
"They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!",0
"Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.",1
"Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.",0
"That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.",2
You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.,2
"Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you.",2
"Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.",2
"I know, it sucks.",2
KFC!!,2
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!,2
"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!",1
"Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!",2
Hey it looks different.,0
A what?,0
"Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!",2
So where's the KFC now?,1
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!,2
"The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.",0
...so no KFC?,1
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!,2
"Mom, drive faster!",2
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!,2
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!,2
Fuck you!,2
"No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside!",2
"No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!",2
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!,2
Nooooooooo-!,2
"Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.",0
I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week.,2
"Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!",2
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!,2
"NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.",2
Yeah. Who isn't?,2
Billy Miller? Seriously??,2
Tommy said you have some KFC.,2
"Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!",2
85 bucks?? I don't have that!,2
How much KFC are we talking?,2
"Holy fuck, dude.",2
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?,2
Are you Teabag?,2
Cut the crap. You got the stuff?,2
Extra crispy?,2
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!,2
IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT!,2
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!,2
Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!,2
"Nothin', it's cool.",2
Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money.,2
"Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here.",2
Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?,2
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?,2
"I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.",2
"Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.",2
"Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!",2
Good.,2
"Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!",2
"Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!",2
"...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.",2
I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.,2
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?,2
"Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.",2
"Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!",2
"What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.",2
"Colonel, how are you doing?",2
"Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel?",2
We had a little problem.,2
"Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?",2
"Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.",2
"Hey, take it easy Colonel.",2
"Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap!",2
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!,2
How the hell do you have more friends than me?,1
"'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.",2
"How many friends do you have, Kenny?",1
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?,1
"Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?",0
Stupid Facebok stuff.,2
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.,0
"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.",1
"Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?",0
"Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.",2
"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page.",1
Surprise!,2
"Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!",0
"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!",1
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!,0
"Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy",2
"Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.",2
"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.",1
You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox.,0
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.,1
"Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.",0
"No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.",0
"...Dad, you are my friend.",0
"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!",0
I just wanna do my homework!,0
"Alright, Dad, I'll add you!",0
"I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit!",1
"...Um, no?",0
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-,0
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-,0
"Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.",0
"Okay, I'm sorry!",0
"""Edit profile. Basic... settings"" Jesus Christ!",0
"...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!",0
"Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.",0
"Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?",0
"Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.",2
Can I come in?,1
"Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?",0
I... don't... have... any... friends...,1
"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.",1
"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.",0
"'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?",1
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!,1
"Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!",0
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!,1
Ah fuck.,0
Okay it says I'm at your farm.,0
"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...",1
"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.",0
"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!",1
...I have no idea.,0
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old!,0
Fine!,0
I don't know you!,0
"...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-",0
"No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""!  ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed!  ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes!",0
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about?,0
"Delete Profile! ""Are you totally sure? Yes or-"" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck?",0
Profile? I'm not a profile.,0
AAH.,0
"'Scuse me, my name is-",0
"Eh hey, could you tell me how I-",0
Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!,0
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.,1
"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.",2
"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.",1
"Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.",2
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.,1
"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?",2
No. What's chatroulette?,1
"Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.",2
"Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.",1
"Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.",2
"Aww, that's some dude jacking off!",1
"Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?",2
That's just a guy's penis too!,1
"Okay let's, let's try this one.",2
"Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!",1
"Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?",2
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.,2
"Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...",2
"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!",1
"Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!",2
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?,0
"No, I seriously don't want any more friends.",0
Okay I'll be your friend.,0
Awww!,0
Why oh oh?,0
Yahtzee?,0
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?,0
Yahtzee.,0
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...,2
"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends!",1
"Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.",2
"Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.",2
"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?",1
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!,1
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!,0
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!,0
Oh yeah? I can try!,0
"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan?",1
"You're an asshole, Kyle!",0
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!,0
"Dude, w-what are you doing?",1
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!,0
Profile status?,1
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!,0
"Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.",1
Dude! Fuck your crops!,0
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.,1
Where?,0
Café World.,1
Son of a bitch!,0
"An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!",1
Jesus Christ.,0
Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!,0
"Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.",1
"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.",1
"Unh, that does it!",1
"Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh!",0
Oh...,0
"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy.",1
"What do you want from me, dude?!",0
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!,0
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!,0
Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously?,0
Yahtzee.,0
Yahtzee. Sixes.,0
Awgh!  Oh thank God.,0
"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.",0
"Fuck off, Dad.",0
"Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!",2
"You should know, fatass.",1
"AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!",2
"Oh God, you guys, really? This again?",0
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.,1
"I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.",2
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff!,0
"Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!",0
"Hey, that is Tom Cruise!",2
"Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.",1
Then why are you packing fudge?,0
"Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.",0
For what?,0
But dude-,0
"Dude, what did you do?",1
I have no idea...,0
Aww... he was packing fudge!,0
"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-",0
Ooooooo...,0
"Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.",1
I saw him once.,0
"Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.",0
"No, dude, it was totally fine.",0
"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...",0
"Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?",2
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...,2
"Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.",0
"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!",0
"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?",1
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?,1
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.,0
Aww come on! This is ridiculous!,1
"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?",1
"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!",0
There doesn't have to be...,1
"Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?",2
"Uh, excuse us for a second...",2
"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?",2
"Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!",2
"If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.",2
"You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!",2
"Yeah, so what?",2
"So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.",2
"What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.",0
But Muhammad can't be seen dad.,1
"No, you can't even show his feet.",0
No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.,2
You just had seven tacos.,2
I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?,2
"You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off!",2
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!,2
I tried getting one last week!,2
"God, will somebody shut her up?",2
"Muhammad, are you okay?",0
They want his power?,0
What kind of extremists are these?,1
"I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time.",2
Let me by...,2
Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.,2
My father...,2
"I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.",2
How could you know anything about who my family is?,2
"If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-",2
We can't give him over to the gingers!,1
"Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.",0
We made a promise... to Jesus!,0
"Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?",2
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.,2
I said GET. Mr. Hat!,2
Put it on!  Do the voice.,2
Keep... your hand... UP!,2
"Dude, we can't do that",0
"By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?",2
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!,2
"It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!",0
"Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.",0
Aw crap.,1
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!,0
"If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!",0
Ahaaa!,2
"Nice work, Conner.",2
"Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!",2
"Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!",0
Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.,0
"Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.",1
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.,0
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!,1
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?,1
"I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on!",1
Them who?!,2
Then start explaining it to me!,2
"Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.",1
"Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!",0
"Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.",1
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!,2
"Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!",0
It's all that matters!,2
"Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!",1
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!,2
"Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.",0
"Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!",1
"Oh, you are not doing that again!",1
Stop talking with your stupid hand!,1
"Who you calling stupid, Jew?",2
"Come on, guys, we're running out of time!",0
That's not cool!,0
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!,1
"We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!",0
"Oh crap, the gingers!",0
Gingers? No!,2
What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!,0
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?,2
"Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?",2
"Hello? I'm here, whoever you are.",2
Daddy?,2
Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.,2
Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.,2
What do you know?!,2
Mom?,2
Protect who??,2
My dad was a Denver Bronco?,2
No- nooo.,2
No! Noooo!,2
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.,0
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.,1
"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.",1
"Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...",0
"Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.",1
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?,2
"Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.",0
My dad was a ginger!,2
"Wwait, what?",1
"I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!",2
"Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!",1
Cheer up? I'm half ginger!,2
"Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.",2
You gotta be kidding me!,1
"Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?",2
"Take it easy, Conner.",2
"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.",0
"Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.",1
"We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!",0
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.,0
"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!",0
"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.",1
"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined!",0
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!,0
"When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.",1
"A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.",0
"Please, sir.",1
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.,0
"Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.",1
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.,1
"Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.",2
"We're here for Towelie, fatass!",1
"I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan-",2
"This is serious, you fucking asshole!",1
"I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!",2
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-,1
"You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?",2
"If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom.",2
"Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?",0
"Cartman, dude, what's wrong?",0
"Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?",2
"Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.",1
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.,2
"""What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""?",1
"I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?!",2
Why not?,0
"Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!",2
"Cartman, tell us.",0
"No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool!",2
"Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.",0
"Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver?",2
"Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.",1
No I can't; I'll always be like this.,2
"Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.",0
"Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes!",2
"I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!",2
"Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!",0
"Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!",2
You love NASCAR huh?,2
"You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless!",2
"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!",1
"I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack.",2
"Dude, you are so retarded!",0
"Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.",2
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!,1
"You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me.",2
"I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!",1
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream.,2
"Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!",2
But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??,2
"Get really psyched up, Butters!",2
"I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!",2
"I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.",2
"Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.",2
"I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.",2
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?,2
"I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.",2
Not yet.,2
"Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!",2
Fucking gross!,2
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!",2
"""Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.""",2
"Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.",2
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?,2
"Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?",2
"Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's...",2
Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!,2
"Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.",2
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!,2
"Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing!",2
"Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.",2
"Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.",2
What's that?,2
Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR!,2
"Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet!",2
"Oh, fuck my ass!",2
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.,2
Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.,2
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.,2
"Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.",2
Aw donkey balls...,2
"Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.",2
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?,2
"Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again.",2
"Oh hey, Kenny.",2
"Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right?",2
"Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.",2
"Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!",2
"Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!",2
"I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.",2
Yeah?,2
...Uh oh.,2
"Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!",2
"Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!",2
"Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny?",2
"Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.",2
"Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.",2
"Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!",2
"Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!",2
"Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.",2
"Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.",2
He's fuckin' gay as hell!,2
"So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!",2
"Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?",2
Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!,2
"Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake!",2
"Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal!",2
"Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!",2
"Oh yeah, I see it.",2
You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!,2
"Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!",2
I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!,2
"Get off my car, Kenny!",2
"We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!",2
"Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny.",2
"Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.",2
Fuckin' gay as hell.,2
"Oh, fuck my ass again!",2
"No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.",2
The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!,2
"Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!",2
"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""?",1
"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage"".",1
She said they're from New Jersey.,1
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.,1
"Know what, Ma?",1
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!,0
"You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.",2
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?,1
"Oops, busted.",2
"They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, ""Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing.""",0
"Aw, crap, there's more of them?",2
Where the hell are they coming from?!,1
"You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!",2
"Hey, dudes.",1
"Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.",2
"Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!",2
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!,2
"No, it doesn't!",1
"He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.",2
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.,1
"Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!",2
What's strike three?!,1
"You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!",2
Shut the fuck up!  What?,1
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?,0
Why does it matter?!,1
"No, uh, it just explains a lot.",0
"Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!",2
"No, it isn't!",1
"Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.",2
"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.",0
"Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!",2
"No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.",1
"Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now.",1
"Not now, Mom. Please.",1
"What am I, Mom?",1
What are you saying?!,1
No! I don't wanna look like this!,1
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!,1
What the hell are you guys doing?!,2
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.,0
And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!,2
"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!",1
"Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!",2
That's enough!,1
"Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!",2
"Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in!",1
"That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!",2
"So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open.",2
"I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!",2
"This is very serious, Butters.",2
"Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.",2
"Come on, you guys, hurry!",2
"Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?",0
"I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!",2
"Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.",2
"Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!",2
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.,1
"Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.",2
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!,1
"Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker!",2
"Dude, what are you doing?",0
"Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.",2
"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?",1
"Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!",2
"No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?",1
You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!,2
"Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?",2
Try to find a way past it!,0
What does it want?!,2
"No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!",2
"Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?",0
"Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!",1
Why?,0
Agggh! Agggh!  No!,1
"Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!",1
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff!,1
"Thank you, Kyle.",2
"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.",0
"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.",1
"Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.",2
"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?",0
"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.",1
"So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth.",2
A note?,0
What's it say?,1
We need to talk.,0
"Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk"" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.",2
"Is something wrong, Wendy?",0
My locker?,0
Are you serious?,0
Well it's just a little messy.,0
Aw come on.,0
"Yeah, alright.",0
"What, come on, it's not that bad.",0
"My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.",0
"Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.",0
"Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-",0
"Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-",0
"Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.",0
"Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-",0
"Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down?",0
"Well no, don't throw that out.",0
"No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich!",0
Dude. What's wrong with you?,1
I don't... I don't know.,0
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.,1
"Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... ""hoarding.""",0
"Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?",0
"Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?",0
"Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-",0
"What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?",0
What the hell's going on?!,0
Mr. Mackey.,0
"Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?",0
"Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!",0
"Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.",0
I'm working on it!,0
"Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office!",0
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?,0
Ohhhhhhh.,0
"Wait wait, where the hell are we now?",0
"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!",0
"Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.",0
Dad? Is that you?,0
Where are you?,0
"The hell are you doing, dad?",0
Did you come here to help me?,0
"Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!",0
DAD!,0
Aaaaaagh!,0
Who's that?,0
What the fuck?,0
"Mr. Mackey, stop running!",0
"Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.",0
"Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.",0
Shut up!,0
You can do it Mr. Mackey.,0
Who are you people?,0
"Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?",0
...Well then why aren't we waking up?,0
"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!",0
I think I have a better idea.,0
"Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.",0
"But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.",1
"Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!",0
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy?,1
Who's Captain Hindsight?,0
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.,0
"Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?",0
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?,2
"I need to speak with him, please.",2
"I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.",2
"Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.",2
"I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.",2
"...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.",2
"Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!",2
"Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir!",2
"Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.",0
"It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf!",0
Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.,2
Asshoooles!,2
"Dad, what are you doing?",0
Aw crap.,0
Can I have a Pop Tart?,0
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.,1
"Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.",0
"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!",0
"Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period.",2
Awww what?!,0
"No, dad! No!",0
"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!",0
Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!,2
"Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!",0
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.,0
"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!",0
"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!",0
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!,0
"No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!",0
"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?",1
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!,0
"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.",1
Oy! Bebebebebebebe.,2
"That's stupid, Cartman.",0
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.,1
"Let's hear it, Cartman!",1
"Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!",2
"You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.",0
"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.",0
"What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!",2
"Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!",2
"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.",0
"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream!",0
"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.",0
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?,1
"Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome!",2
Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives!,2
"Let me see your iPad, Cartman.",0
"Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom!",2
"Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.",1
"No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!",2
"So, plug it in.",1
"I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid!",2
"Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!",2
"YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!",2
"You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.",1
"Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y-",1
What? Ready for what?,1
"What ""agreement""?!",1
Hey! You can't do that!,1
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!,1
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!,1
"It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!",1
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?,0
"I don't know, I didn't read them!",1
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?,1
I do.,0
"You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?",1
"Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right?",1
Gahhh!,1
"Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!",1
"Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!",1
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-,1
AAHH!,1
Dad! You tasered my dad!,1
"Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!",2
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!,2
"Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?",2
"Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!",2
Toshiba Handibook??,2
"Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!",2
"Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!",2
"You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!",2
But I told you I was sorry.,2
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.,2
"Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.",2
"Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?",2
Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED!,2
What is this? What's going on?,1
"Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!",1
We didn't read them!,1
The first what?,1
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.,0
"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.",0
(I need some help! I can't take it!),1
(I can't take it! I want out right now!),1
(Yes! Please! Let me go!),1
(You're fine!),1
(Yaaaaah!),1
Yes! She fucks me so hard!,2
"Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!",2
At Best Buy.,2
Uh huh.,2
No!,2
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now!,2
Booooooo!,2
"She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...",2
"You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!",2
An iPad???,2
"Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time.",0
"Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.",0
69ingchipmunks@me.com,0
"Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.",0
(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!),1
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!),1
(NOOOO!),1
"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.)",1
"(Oh, shit!)",1
"No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.",0
I think Verizon.,0
"Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!",2
(Yes. I promise I'll read.),1
"Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?",0
"Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!",2
"What?! Hey, that's mine!",2
"Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me!",2
What's this?,2
"Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.",1
"Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.",0
"Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.",1
"Oh man, really?",0
Can we go now?,0
"Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!",2
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!,0
"Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!",2
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!,1
Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!,2
"Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!",1
"Ugh, let me talk to them.",2
"Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler.",2
Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen.,2
"Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch.",2
"Well, I tried.",2
What the hell are they gonna do to us?,0
"Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?",2
"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.",0
"He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat.""",2
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.,0
"Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!",2
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore.,0
"Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.",2
"Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-",0
"Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.",1
"Here we go, this has gotta be it right here.",2
"'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.",0
"Butters! Butters, is everything okay?",1
"Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!",1
"I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.",1
What the hell are you doing?!,0
"Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?",0
"Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!",1
"It's kind of funny, you guys.",2
"Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.",2
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?,0
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?,2
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?,1
"Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.",1
Paradox...,2
It's working!,1
That's it! Hurry! Gooo!,0
Okay we got it! We got it!,0
"Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.",0
"No problem, Funnybot.",1
Or will there be?,2
"Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?",1
...I don't know.,1
"Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?",1
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-,1
I'm just doing the line.,1
"Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.",1
"Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?",1
"I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada.",1
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.,0
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.,2
"Hmmm, yeah.",1
"...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.",1
"No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.",0
Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!,2
I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!,2
"You get in trouble again, Cartman?",1
"No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!",2
"Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.",0
"Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!",2
"Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!",2
No they didn't.,1
Yeah they fucking did Kyle!,2
"Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?",0
"Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!",2
Go look for yourselves!!,2
"There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!",2
"Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!",2
How big do they say mine is?,1
"Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.",0
"No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!",2
"They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!",2
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.,1
"Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!",2
"Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.",2
"Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters.",2
"Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.",2
"Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.",2
"Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.",2
"Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?",2
Didn't you forget something?,1
"What, Kyle?",2
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.,1
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top.,2
Thirteen point seven inches?,1
"Yeah, it's pretty good.",2
Your wiener is not 13 inches long!,1
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.,0
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!,2
You just did that to everybody in class!,0
"Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead!",2
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup.,0
"There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!",2
"Oh, Goddamnit!",2
Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!,2
For what?!,2
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!,2
"I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!",2
"You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!",2
Those weren't our dick sizes?,2
I don't know! Why would you?!,2
Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!,2
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?,2
Fuck you! No I don't!,2
"Honestly, I wouldn't really care.",2
I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!,2
Why the fuck am I here?!,2
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!,2
"Oh, that's cool.",2
My penis is 13 inches long.,2
Yeah dude!,2
"Burn it down, dude!",2
The Jews!,2
"No, and fuck Kyle!",2
"Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!",2
"Wait, what?",2
"Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!",2
I'm still fucking angry!,2
"Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!",1
I know! This is awesome!,0
I'm so happy!,1
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!,1
"Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch!",1
"Aw dude, that's so sad.",0
Why do they have to put this on TV?!,1
"Awww dude, awwww.",0
"Aaaggh, God.",1
"I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude!",1
What exactly can I do to help?,1
"Oh it's, it's so sad.",1
Oh. Hey Kyle.,2
What are you doing here?,1
I'm volunteering.,2
...What are you doing here?!,1
"I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.",2
Why do you have a video camera?,1
"I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow.",2
"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?",1
Thanks.,1
What's going on?!,1
"Ah, crap!",2
"Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.",2
So what are you doing?!,1
"What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.",2
"Alright, what is it?!",1
"Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!",2
Why do you need me?,1
"Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!",2
I knew you were doing something terrible!,1
"What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!",2
Lots of people will when I tell them!,1
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days.,2
You what?,1
"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.",2
A thousand dollars.,1
"Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.",2
After you.,2
There's a big wait to sit down.,1
Come on.,2
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.,2
Jesus Christ.,1
"It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.",2
"Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.",2
Wow...,1
"We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.",2
"You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free.",2
"Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.",2
"And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.",1
"Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm.",2
"Go long, Token! Go go!",0
"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.",1
"Wow, really?",0
"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.",1
Doing what?,0
Crack baby... basketball.,1
...Dude.,0
"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?",1
Betsy MacIntosh?,2
We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?,2
"We need to speak with you, ma'am.",2
And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?,2
"Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association.",2
"We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?",2
Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.,2
"Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.",2
"I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-",2
"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters?",2
"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that?",1
...You sound like Cartmam.,0
"Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!",1
"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.",0
"I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya.",1
It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!,2
"Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.",2
I need to talk to you.,1
"Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?",2
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.,1
They can't make money. It's against the rules.,2
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.,1
"Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.",2
Gut they're the ones risking injury.,1
"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!",2
"The government could come after us, Cartman.",1
"We're a non-profit company, Kyle.",2
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?,1
"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look.",2
A hot tub?!,1
"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it.",2
Gravy?,1
Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.,2
"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".",2
"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.",1
It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.,2
What other companies?,1
Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.,2
"My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.",2
"You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.",2
"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?",2
"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?",2
"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.",2
"You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home!",2
"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!",1
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?,0
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal!,1
"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!",2
How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!,2
"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!",2
"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!",2
"Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.",1
"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!",1
"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!",2
"This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work!",2
"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?",1
Vunter Slash?,2
"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?",2
"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?",2
Are you fucking serious?,2
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God.,0
You knew about this??,2
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ.,0
"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!",1
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.,1
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!,1
"I just can't believe Slash isn't real,",2
"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!",1
"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.",2
"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!",1
It's what?,0
"This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?",1
But who paid for all this?,1
"Kyle, Kyle! Look.",0
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.,1
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.,0
"He is real, you guys.",2
"Alright now, open presents! Open presents!",2
Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?,2
Yaaaay!,2
Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.,1
What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?,2
"Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.",0
"Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?",2
"Here, this one's from me, Stan.",1
"Oh thanks, dude.",0
"Stan's getting another present, Mom.",2
"Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?",2
"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?",0
Yeah dude!,1
Yeah they're the best!,1
"Mom, I'm 10 years old now.",0
"Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?",2
But that's our music! We like it!,1
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!,0
That sounds like shit!,0
Gross!,1
Turn it off dude!,2
"I know, Mom. I love you too.",0
"It's okay, Mom. I understand.",0
'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell?,0
"Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this!",1
"Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer.",2
Hey Stan.,1
Hey dudes.,0
"Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.",1
"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?",0
Sure.  What's up?,1
"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.",0
Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.,1
"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.",0
Why? What's it sound like?,1
It... kind of sounds like shit.,0
"What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?",1
"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?",0
That doesn't sound like shit to you?,0
"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.",1
"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.",0
"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.",0
I just turned 10.,0
So this is normal?,0
Sounds like shit.,0
Uh that sounds like shit too.,0
"Yeah dude, it's just shit.",0
They both look the same.,0
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.,0
"Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!",2
"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?",1
"He's lying, dude. Hit X",2
Hey guys.,0
"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?",1
He said I have cynicism?,0
"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.",0
"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.",1
"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?",0
"Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.",2
"Yeah, we got him!",1
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.,0
We're gonna level up to detective!,1
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.,0
"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?",1
"Aw, dude, this looks like shit.",0
You don't wanna eat it?,1
"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.",0
Look like ice cream to me.,2
"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?",1
"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.",0
"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?",1
"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.",0
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.,0
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?,0
"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit.",0
I know! That's so hilarious!,1
I thought you guys were sick!,0
"...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny.",2
"Dude, you totally lied to me!",0
"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-",1
Where were you guys going?!,0
"Alright dude, we were going to the movies.",1
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.,0
"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!""",1
You guys... don't wanna be around me?,0
"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.",1
"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.",0
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.,1
I won't say a word.,0
Oh shit.,0
"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?!",0
"Oh cool, the movie trailers!",2
Awww God!,0
"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!",1
"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.",0
That looks pretty good.,2
How can you say that looks good?!,0
"Shhh, you're doing it again!",1
Ugh.,0
"Stan, knock it off!",2
But it's just crap.,0
"No, they're penguins! Stop it!",1
"Oh come on, people!",0
"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you!",1
"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.",0
"No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.",2
Me?! Did you see that shit?!,0
Hang on guys!,0
"Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head!",2
Kyle?,0
"Dude, you've... you've changed.",1
"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?",0
"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo-",1
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!,1
"Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!",2
Yep!,2
"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!",1
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?,2
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!,1
Wait what?,2
That's what they're talking about on the news!,1
"Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?",2
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!,2
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!,1
"Okay, you're on, Jew!",2
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers?,2
"That's right, it's a butt fungus.",2
"God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up!",0
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.,0
"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy?",0
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-,2
Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.,2
"Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!",2
I-I'll try. I'll try.,2
A what??,2
Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??,2
"What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!",2
Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!,2
"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.",1
"I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.",1
"NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.",1
Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!,2
What's the matter dude?,1
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!,2
"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.",1
Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.,1
"Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!",1
"Gee, thanks Kyle!",2
"Wait, it's not a real illness?",0
"Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!",0
"Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.",2
"There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.",2
"How are we doing on those patties, Jew?",2
"About three minutes, fatass!",1
Nice!,2
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.,2
"Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?",1
"I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go!",2
Aliens?,0
Because of aliens?,0
Yeah I'm ready!,0
Ahhhh!  Oh coool!,0
Adam Sandler's funny.,0
Kyle!,0
"Hey, Stan!",1
"Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!",0
"Stan, are you alright?",1
"Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.",0
"Really? Uh, Stan, that's great.",1
"But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on!",0
Dude. Have you been drinking?,1
"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!",0
"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.",1
"...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept?",0
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.,1
"Everything alright here, Kyle?",2
"Yeah, it's fine.",1
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.,2
"Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.",1
"Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!",0
"Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.",1
"Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you.",0
I feel like total shit.,0
The rock creatures?,0
"Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...",0
Ugh God.,0
Aughah.,0
...Enchirito?,0
What? You guys are aliens?,0
"Dude, I don't know!",0
I'm not friends with him.,0
"No, no, we don't hang out anymore.",0
"Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!",0
I don't know!,0
"There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.",1
"Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.",2
"Next please.  Oh, hey.",1
"Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.",0
What are you doing?,1
How do you guys make them so yummy?,0
"Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger",0
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!,1
"No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.",0
"Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!",1
"Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!",0
"You said ""fuck you"" to my face, Stan.",1
"Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.",0
"Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.",1
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!,0
"No, I'm done with that!",0
"I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.",0
"Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited.",0
"No, dad, no. No, please!",0
"No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.",0
"You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!",1
"Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!",1
The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier!,2
"...K, coming.",0
"Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!",2
"Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!",2
"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.",0
"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.",0
"Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.",1
Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican!,2
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!,1
"He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!",2
Better than being a fatass Texan!,1
Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!,2
"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!",1
"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!",2
Base!,0
Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!,2
"Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!",2
"Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!",2
"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up!",2
Oh God!,2
"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet.""",0
"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.",0
I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!,2
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!,1
"At least I have an asshole, Kyle!",2
"No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!",2
Where is Butters?,2
He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?,1
"Yeah, I think he was. Wait.",0
Butters?,1
Butters!,0
"Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.",1
"All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!",2
"Wugh, game on.",1
"Cartman, what the hell is this?!",1
"You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.",2
"""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?!",1
"You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.",2
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!,1
"Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?",2
Oh dude. Sweet.,2
This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.,2
Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.,2
"No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.",2
"Wait a minute, isn't that...",2
Oh no you don't!,2
That asshole is not getting across my border!,2
No you won't Butters!,2
¡Respeto mi autóridad!,2
"Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO!",2
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,2
"Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!",1
"I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!",2
"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.",0
"Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco.",1
A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...,2
"YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??",2
"You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?",2
The blond kid?,1
"Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!",2
What about him?,0
"He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans!",2
How do you know?!,1
"Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!",2
Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school!,2
"Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.",2
Turn it up.,0
"Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it!",2
"Dude, that's so wrong!",1
"Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman.""",2
"Oh Jesus, what now?!",2
"Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny!",2
"Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.",2
"Yeah, he killed himself.",2
Hey! Whoooa.,2
"'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!",2
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!,2
"Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.",2
Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!,2
You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?,2
No way.,0
What's up?,1
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!,0
"Dude, that's fucked up.",1
"Come on dude, it's pretty funny.",0
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??,1
"Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.",0
"Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?",2
"Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?",2
"So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes.",2
I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.,2
"I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time.",2
"You okay, Jenny?",2
"Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class.",2
"Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.",2
"Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.",2
Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!,2
WAY worse!,2
"Alright, kewl.",2
"You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper!",2
"Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!",2
"Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?",2
"Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved.",2
"Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here?",2
"Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her ""soft-serve Simon.""",0
That's not funny.,1
I'm not looking at that!,1
"Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!",0
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!,1
I wouldn't care.,0
"Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!",0
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!,0
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!,0
That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.,0
"No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.",0
"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.",0
"This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.",0
"So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?",1
"Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!",0
"Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!",0
What? How do you know?,0
Where is it coming from?,1
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.,1
We only have music class on Thursday.,0
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!,1
Oh I'm ready!,0
One.  Two. Three!,1
Get it!,1
Don't let him get away!,0
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?,0
Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.,1
Stop that rat!,0
Knock it off!,0
"Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.",2
"Yeah, I think they're all ready.",2
It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.,2
"Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!",2
Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come!,2
"No thanks. Okay, proceed.",2
That. Was. Amazing.,2
"You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.",0
Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?,0
What is that thing?,1
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?,0
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!,1
Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?,0
"Come on, guys!",0
"Quick, we need something to carry him in!",0
Here's a shoebox!,1
"We just need to borrow him, kid.",0
"Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!",0
Grab him!,1
"Whoa whoa wait, wait!",0
Can't this thing go any faster?,0
"Craig, are we still clear?",0
What the hell happened?!,1
"Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!",0
"Stop right there, you little rat!",0
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.,0
"Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.",1
"Boy, I say.",2
It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.,2
"Oh, you're most certainly welcome.",2
"Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?",2
I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.,2
"Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?",0
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!,2
"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off!",0
"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?",0
No. Dad. Please don't do this!,0
"Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?",0
God this sucks!,0
Four weeks we gotta do this?,1
"Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it.",2
"Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit.",2
"Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?",2
"Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!",0
"Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.",2
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!,0
"Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.",2
Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!,2
Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!,2
"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby!",0
"Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.",2
"I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.",2
"What do you mean, Peter Panda?",2
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.,2
"Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.",0
"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you!",2
"Mom, have you been here all day?!",2
Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!,2
Am I sure?? Look at this place!,2
"Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!",2
No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog!,2
Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG!,2
"I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-",2
"Shut the hell up, Cartman!",1
Got something to say Kyle?!,2
How do you murder a stuffed animal?!,1
"How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please.",2
"Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-",2
Fly bu-what?,2
Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...,2
"Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.",2
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.,2
"I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!",2
"What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?",2
"Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.",2
"That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.",2
"So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.",2
"What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!",2
Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!,2
"Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!",2
Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!,2
"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?",1
"Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?",0
"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.",1
"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.",2
"Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.",2
"What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?",2
"Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.",2
"Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!",2
What?! Who?!,2
"I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back!",2
"Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here!",2
"Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!",2
"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!",1
Oh sure!,2
"Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.",0
"Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!",2
HAAAAGH!,2
"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!",0
I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?!,2
"Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?!",2
Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!!,2
Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ!,2
Who did this to you?!,2
"Don't worry, I'll get you down!",2
AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??,2
Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?,2
...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda!,2
They were your FRIENDS!,2
"Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!",2
"There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.",2
Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!,2
"Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.",2
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.,1
Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you?,2
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?,2
"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.",1
"Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.",2
"Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!",1
"Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.",2
"We all have to do this report together, dude.",0
"You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.",2
How is that gonna help?!,1
"Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.",2
"Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?",2
Uh-huh??,2
What? This isn't history.,1
"Dude, it is called History Channel.",0
"Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?",2
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!,1
"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report?",2
"Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle?",2
"Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!",1
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?,2
"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.",2
"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!",1
"See what I mean, you guys?",2
'bout what?,0
"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.",1
We saw it on your channel.,1
"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?",0
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!,1
"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV.",0
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them.,1
...Uh oh.,1
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-,1
Ack dude!,1
"Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?",2
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!,2
Oh no. Oh NO!,2
"Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store!",2
You guys have stuffing?!,2
"Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!",2
NO!,2
"I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?",0
"Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!",1
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.,0
Would you guys stop!,1
Dude!,0
"Yeah, go on dude!",0
I didn't think so.,0
Who's this?,0
"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.",0
"No, ah I don't.",1
I actually only just said that sarcastically.,1
"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.",1
I'm not a professor.,1
You are the fucking History Channel!,1
"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?",1
"Wow, awesome. Um...",1
"Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.",1
Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?,1
"Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd",1
"You know, could youuu...",1
Would you please just open your wormhole?!,1
Errh!,1
"Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all.",1
"It's cool dude, we understand.",0
I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand.,1
"Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.",0
"Yeah, History Channel rules.",2
Uhhh??,2
"Oh, come on!!",1
"Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.",2
Did you hear anything more about what happened?,0
"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.",1
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.,0
"Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.",2
"Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!",2
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!,1
"Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart?",2
"Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention.",2
"This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!",2
Eh yeah?,2
"Heh heh, yeah?",2
Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.,2
"Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!",2
"Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!",2
"My name. Is not. ""Kyel.""",1
That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want!,2
"Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.",2
"Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?",2
"You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!",2
"Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!",2
"We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!",2
"Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!",2
"IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!!",2
My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.,2
"What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.",2
"Yeah, yeah.",2
"Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!",2
"Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam!",2
A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!,2
How?!,2
"Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!",2
"Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?",2
"Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.",2
What??  Greeley?,2
"What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!",2
You're my new mom?,2
"Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?",2
"Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!",2
Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM!,2
"Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.",2
"You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny!",2
"Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!",2
"YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!",2
"Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS.",2
I wasn't making fun of anybody.,2
I was just teasing.,2
"My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!",2
Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!,2
"Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!",2
I'm not saying it.,2
I'm not saying it!,2
"Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!",2
"Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.",0
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.,1
"There he is, there's my buddy.",2
"How was jail, fatass?!",1
"Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-",2
...What the fuck?!,0
"Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone.""",2
"Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde!",0
"Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.",2
Is your mom always like that dude?,1
"Of course, man. It's cool.",2
"Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends!",2
"Cartman, it was actually really lame.",1
"I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.",2
"Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.",2
"I know, fatass. I was there.",1
"His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.""",2
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.,1
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.,2
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?,1
Nuh-uh.,2
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all.,1
They are trying to save Clyde's mom.,0
From what?,1
They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.,2
"Mom, get the door!",2
Who are these buttholes?,2
My potty? What are they going to do to it?,2
"Hey, hey! That's my bathroom!",2
"Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.",2
"Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.",2
"Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.",1
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.,0
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.,1
"All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.",1
"Aw, he's dead?",1
So then we can't sue him?,0
"Wow, really?!",0
You hear that Clyde?,1
How expensive?,0
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance,1
This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!,2
"Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!",2
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?,2
"Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.",2
"Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.",2
"Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?",2
"Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.",2
So what does that mean?,0
"Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?",2
"Oh boy, here we go.",2
"So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot.",2
"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?",2
"Clyde, you there? Hello?",2
"Nice bolo tie, Stan.",2
Thanks.,0
Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.,2
"Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.",0
"No, dude, it's... badass.",2
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!,0
That... was six grand?,1
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.,0
"...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.",2
"I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!",0
"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it.",1
"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.",0
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.,0
Fifteen bucks?!,0
"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!",1
"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of!",0
"You may suck our collective balls, sir!",2
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.,1
Yeah! Here's one.,0
"Yeah dude, you can test them.",0
This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!,0
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo.,0
A six-layer burrito?,0
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!,1
"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?",0
"Dude, that's terrible!",1
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.,2
"But, how do they get away with that?",0
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend.,2
"For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes.",2
That's the chemical equation for gold?,1
"That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold.",2
"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?",1
"Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!",2
Grandpa?,0
Grandpa.,0
"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.",0
"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.",0
"Yes, Grandpa.",0
"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this!",0
"Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-",2
"Butters, what the fuck?!",2
"""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business!",2
"Oh ahhhh, three bucks.",2
We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.,2
"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?",0
"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?",0
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.,0
No i wouldn't.,0
"No, because I really want you to kill yourself.",0
"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!",0
"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.",0
I'm not joking.  Do it.,0
"Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?",2
"YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?",2
"Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?",2
"Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.",2
"Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!""",2
"Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.",2
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.,2
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!,0
"Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: ""Whoever smelt it, dealt it!""",0
What does that mean?,1
"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!",0
"Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!""",1
"Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!",2
"Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.",2
"I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.",2
"Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.",2
"And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.",2
How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.,2
What d'ja say?,2
Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?,2
"Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!",2
"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!",2
"You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!",2
You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?!,0
"You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!",2
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!,2
"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!",1
"No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!",2
"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace!",0
What's he doing?,1
"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.",0
"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.",0
"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something.",0
"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.",0
"Tango, Tango, I'm in position.",0
"Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?",1
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.,0
"Alright, Butters. Bring it in.",1
"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.",1
"I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.",2
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.,0
Go Cartman!,1
"Go, go, go.",0
"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys.",2
"Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.",2
"Oh, God. That was boring.",2
"So, what do you want to do now?",1
"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.",2
"Oh, that's a good idea.",0
"Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.",2
"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?",1
"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?",2
Really?,2
"Dude, we are on the front page!",0
"Can we get a different pose, please?",0
"What's it say, what's it say?",2
"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.",0
What? Let me see that.,2
How can that be? Already?,1
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.,0
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.,1
"""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive.""",0
Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?,2
That's all it is?,0
You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog.,2
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.,1
"I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.",2
How is this Kyle? This good?,2
"Yep, that's great.",1
"Cool, these will be good uploads.",2
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?,2
"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.",0
Why don't you make me?,2
"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!",2
"Well, I'm glad we took care of that.",0
"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?",1
I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.,2
That's a cool idea,0
"W-what's the matter, Kenny?",1
What seems pointless?,0
"Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?",1
"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.",0
"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.",2
Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.,0
"Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long-",0
"Dude, what's going on?",2
"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?",0
"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?",1
"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.",0
"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?",2
Benedict Arnold.,1
"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back.",0
Kenny?,1
"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants.",0
You guys are sellouts.,1
"Come on, Kyle.",2
You're freaking sellouts!,1
"It's okay, man, come on.",2
"Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there.",1
"Get a couple facing the other way, brah.",2
"Yeah, good idea.",1
"We have to face it, Cartman.",1
I know. I know Kyle.,2
I really thought it was gonna last.,1
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes.,2
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-,1
"No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.",2
I-It's good that it became something else.,1
And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff.,2
"Okay, that's good, a little higher.",0
"Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?",2
"Yeah, that's awesome.",1
"OK, whenever you're ready.",0
"No, kitty, you have to be quiet.",2
No kitty! That's a bad kitty!,2
"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.",1
"Alright, go Cartman.",0
Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!,2
"Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.",0
It's super awesome.,1
"Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.",2
"SHUT UP, KITTY!",2
Fox trot standing by at position alpha.,0
"Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.",1
Standing by in three seconds.,0
"Two, one. Go Cartman!",1
Let's do this.,2
"Cartman? Go, Cartman.",1
"Come on, dude. Hurry.",0
"No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing.",2
"Yeah. Do it, Cartman.",1
"Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.",2
Wow!,0
We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.,2
"Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.",2
"Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.",2
"Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?",2
"Interesting, and why is it called Passover again?",2
"So interesting, wow.",2
Get out of here.,1
"Oh, hey, Kyle.",2
Get. Outta here!,1
"Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.",2
What are you gonna do?,1
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?,2
No?,1
"Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.",2
What does that have to do with Passover?,1
"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA!",2
"Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.",2
"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.",2
"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.",2
"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...",2
"Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!",2
"Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.",2
"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.",2
"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.",1
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?,2
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.,1
"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.",2
"If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!",1
"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.",2
"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.",2
"Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.",2
Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.,2
"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.",2
JESUS IS A LIE!,2
"Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.",2
"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!",2
"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?",2
Sh! You hear that?,2
"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.",2
"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.",2
"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath.",2
"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here.",2
That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.,2
Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe!,2
"Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.",2
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!,1
"People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.",2
"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.",1
"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!",2
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.,2
"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.",2
"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.",2
Heh. What do you mean?,2
"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?",2
"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.",2
Why?,2
"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?",2
"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle?",2
"Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?",2
Guys?!,2
"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!",2
What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!,2
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?,2
Wingstreet?!,2
"Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!",2
HUH?!,2
Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!,2
"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?",2
This isn't safe or fun!,2
"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!",2
"Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.",2
"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.",1
"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.",2
It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do!,2
"Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha-",2
Ugh... what... where...,2
Ugh... what?  What's going on?,2
"It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?",2
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.,1
"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.",2
"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!",1
"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.",2
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!,1
What does that mean?,2
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.,1
"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?",2
That's just how God is.,1
"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick!",2
"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?",2
"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.",2
"Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that.",2
"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.",2
"I love you, dad.",2
And our love grows,2
"Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?",2
This is what God told us to do!,1
"No, Kyle! I don't believe you!",2
You'll see!,1
Noooo!,2
Noooooo!,2
No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh!,2
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...!,2
No! No! The bread is all flat! No!,2
"I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.",2
"Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.",2
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.,2
"I know, you're not.",1
"Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!",2
"Happy Passover, Cartman.",1
"Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.",2
"Where's your lunch, Butters?",1
"Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?",0
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.,0
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.,0
He has a point.,2
"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.",1
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!,0
I have balls.,2
Still balls.,2
"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?",1
I'll do it! I'll be in charge.,0
"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.",0
"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!",0
"Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.",2
My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o,2
Pansy.,1
"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.",0
"Butters, you're the star of the video!",0
"He doesn't wanna do it, dude.",1
"Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?",0
"Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!",0
"Why are you doing this, Stan?",1
To stop bullying.,0
You're gonna stop bullying.,1
YES.,0
With Cartman singing about his vagina.,1
"...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-",0
"Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!",1
"Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!",0
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego.,1
What the hell does that mean?,0
"Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!",0
"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!",0
"I know, right?!",0
"Oh, hey.",0
"But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-",0
"'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl.",2
"Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!",1
"We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come!",2
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God.,1
"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?",0
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?,1
"Butters is totally fine with it, dude.",0
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!,1
"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!",0
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!,1
Oh yeah.,0
"Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.",1
"This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!",0
"If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!",1
"...What, what was the question again?",0
"If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!",1
"...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!",0
"Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help!",1
Why does he keep saying that?,0
"Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it.",0
I didn't know.,0
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!,0
"Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?",0
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?,0
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!,2
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?,0
Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.,0
"I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.",0
AAAAAAAH! I can't take it!,1
Somebody help us!,2
We were stuck. We were completely stuck.,1
"Kyle, hurry!",2
"Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle!",0
No!,0
Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!,0
"We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.",0
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide,1
"Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.",2
"Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.",2
"No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.",2
"Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?",0
"And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.",1
"Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!",2
We've definitely not done that before!,1
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.,0
Cool! Ziplining.,1
Ziplining. Hell yeah.,2
"We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.",2
"Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.",2
"Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.",2
"And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""",1
Alright!,2
"And we were like, ""Other? We have to do this with other people?""",0
Good. How are you?,0
"So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late.",1
We don't mind.,1
"Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video.",2
"It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell.",0
...No.,2
"""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?""",0
Finally!,2
...Shuttle?,0
"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?",1
"Well, come on, we don't have a choice.",2
Uh that's okay.,0
"Dude, did you fart?!",1
"Mmmm, no?",2
Thank God.,0
The trees' biology?,2
I think we're good.,0
"So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining!",0
Zipliiine.,2
"Well? How was it, Cartman?",1
"Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!",2
"Oh, really??",0
"Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!",2
Zipline.,1
"It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.",1
"""The next zipline? What are you talking about?""",2
"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?",1
And it was like WHAM.,0
STOP!,1
NOOOO!,2
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!,2
Wugh!,1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!,1
I'm so fucking bored!,2
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.,1
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.,0
Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us!,1
"We should have never listened to you, Kyle.",2
Me?!,1
"Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!""",2
"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!",1
I brought it up because you already brought it up!,2
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.,0
You fat piece of shit!,1
Fuck you Kyle!,2
"Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!",0
"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?",0
DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!,1
Nnnn-mo...,2
"So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.",0
"Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?",0
"Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy!",2
"The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!",1
"This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.",2
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!,1
"If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!",2
"Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.",0
...Yyyeah.,0
"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.",0
"Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.",1
"Yea, please!",0
"Oh, thank God!",1
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.,0
NOOO!,2
AAAAH!,1
Eeeeugh.,2
Can we please go faster?!,1
AAAAAAAAAAH!,1
Uh oh.,2
"Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!",0
Just go. Go without me.,1
"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!",0
"I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan.",1
"I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought ""I can find us a way out!"" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.",0
"You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!",0
A marina?,2
"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!",0
What's the point?,1
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?!,0
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!,1
"Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!",2
"Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!",1
"Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?",2
Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!,1
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.,0
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!,2
Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!,1
"I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.",1
I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!,2
...Kenny? Kenny!,0
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!",1
"No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!",2
"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!",1
"And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!""",0
Stop it! It was me! My idea.,0
You?!,2
"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together.",0
"So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!",1
"If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano.",0
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!,1
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.,0
You... You killed Kenny!,2
"You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan!",1
"How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.",1
"The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.",0
It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.,2
You came for us!,2
Mr. Hankey!,1
Thank you.  Mr. Hankey.,0
We were saved. It was over.,2
"No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.",2
"It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea.",2
"Just tell us, Butters.",1
"Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.",2
"Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.",2
"Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?",2
"What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.",2
"Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.",2
Will you shut the hell up?!,1
...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?,2
"Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys?",2
"Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.",2
"Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?",2
"Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?",2
"Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.",2
"W-yeah, of course.",2
"Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?",2
"Thanks, you guys.",2
WHAT?! KYLE?!,2
Motherfucker!,2
"Hey, ah, Nichole, right?",2
"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?",2
"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?",2
"Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.",2
"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.",2
"Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch.",2
"Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!",1
"Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.",2
"Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.",2
"No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.",2
"Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys!",2
"Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?",1
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?,1
"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!",1
"Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya!",1
"It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately.",1
"Oh my God, this is sooo cute.",2
Ohhhhh my God.,2
"You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me.",2
"I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?",2
"Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead.",2
"Dude, why are you so into their relationship?",0
"I don't know, it's just so... perfect.",2
You motherfucker!,1
"Kyle, Jesus Christ!",2
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!,1
"Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?",2
"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!",1
"Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!",2
"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!",1
"Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!",2
"Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.",0
Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.,2
"Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.",2
Nothing.,2
Who is Cupid Me?!,1
Nobody.,2
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!,1
Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!,2
God-damnit!,1
"Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?!",2
"Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!",2
"That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!",2
"Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.",2
"You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you!",2
I'm gonna get you!,2
I almost got you! Almost!,2
"Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho!",2
It's not fair! They were so... happy!,2
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!,2
"No, they won't!",2
"No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!",2
And you! I should never have believed in you!,2
I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die!,2
Hey man. You okay?,1
What happened? It just didn't work out?,1
"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?",1
"So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?",1
"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?",1
"Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?",1
That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.,2
"Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.",2
"Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars.",2
"Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.",2
"Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.",2
Denver Nuggets game?,2
NOOOOOOO!,2
Nooooooo!,2
NOOOOOOO.,2
No time! NOOOOOOO!,2
"Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle.",2
"I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!",2
"I swear, Kyle.",2
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together!,1
"Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.",2
"Oh my gohhhd, so cute!",2
"That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.",2
Really?!,2
"What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!",2
"Hey, stop it!",2
Nooo!,2
"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.",0
We don't have kickoffs anymore.,1
"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.",0
"Dad, do we really have to wear bras?",0
This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!,1
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!,0
"Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!",2
We don't even understand how this game is played.,1
That's true.,2
"Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.",2
"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?",1
"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.",0
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!,1
I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.,0
We can't.,1
Who needs a coach? We have Butters.,2
"The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.",0
"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.",2
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?,0
"We need you, Butters. You're the man!",1
"Hey Butters, you got a minute?",2
"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.",2
"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.",2
...I don't have a dad.,2
Youuu save it all?,2
"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?",2
"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.",2
Holy shit I think I do.,2
"Cartman, you idiot!",0
That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.,2
"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!",0
"Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!",0
"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?",0
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.,2
Yeah Dad. You need some of this.,0
"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?",0
"Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher?",2
"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.",1
"I'm not fat, Kyle.",2
"Right, you're not fat.",1
"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch!",2
Whoa duude!,0
"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy?",1
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.,2
Why do they even allow those things in stored?,1
"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front.",0
You've gotta be kidding me!,1
"Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!",2
"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year!",1
"Yeah... Yeah, here you go.",2
"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?",2
Why?,1
"I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.",2
"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-",1
"No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!",2
Oh no!,1
"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos.",2
You don't need that! Get off of it.,1
"Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once.",2
"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!",1
"Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle.",2
"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house.",2
So take a shit somewhere else!,1
"That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.",2
"Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle.",2
Out of the way. Out of the way please.,2
"Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!",2
"Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.",2
"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?",2
"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well.",2
You have got to be kidding me!,1
"What, Kyle?!",2
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!,1
"You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!",2
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!,1
"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!",2
Who's Honey Boo Boo?,1
"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?",0
"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.",1
"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.",0
"Come on, hurry it up in there!",1
"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick.",2
This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!,1
Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!,1
"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?",1
"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.",1
"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera!",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue.",1
Fatty Doo Doo?,1
What have you done?,1
"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!",1
"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??",1
"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?",1
"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?",1
"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?",0
"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.",1
"Dude! Dude, not cool!",0
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.,0
What? Oh my God.,1
Yeah dude. It's really serious.,0
"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!",2
"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.",1
"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!",2
You found a network to buy it?,1
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!,2
"I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down!",2
"You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!",2
I'm pissed!,2
"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!",2
"I ain't done with you, bitch!",2
"Dude, you okay?",0
"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan.",1
Oh! You fucking bitch!,2
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.,1
"Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?",1
"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-",1
"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.",1
"Dude, what happened?",0
Take a look.,1
What's this?,0
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.,1
Whoa!,0
"Dude, no way!",2
Yeah dude.,1
"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex?",0
"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.",1
Well are you gonna tell your dad?,0
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.,1
"Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?",2
"Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?",2
"Cartman dude, not now.",0
"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!",2
"Oh no, really?",2
"Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!",2
What-what do you mean?,2
"Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!",2
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!,2
Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?,2
"Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!",2
"Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.",2
"Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.",2
Sorry about this.,2
"'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!",2
"That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!",2
"I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!",2
"You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?",2
"Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!",2
Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!,2
"He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!",2
"Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!",2
Who is there?,2
"Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?",2
A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!,2
"Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!",2
Heh- hello?,2
"No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!",2
"Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!",2
"Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!",2
Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom!,2
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.,1
"You're gonna have to tell him, dude.",0
I know...,1
HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW!,2
"Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.",2
"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!",1
"Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!",2
"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!",1
What?  Hello?,2
"Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.",2
"Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.",2
"No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs.",2
My password is uloveboobs!,2
"You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!",2
"Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.",2
"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.",1
"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself.",1
"Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?",1
"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?",1
"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!",1
"Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.",2
"God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello?",2
"Dude, come down here!",1
"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?",1
"It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay.",2
FELLAS! Fellas!,2
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!,2
Butters?  Why?,1
"It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!",2
You're talking about Butters.,0
"Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom!",2
Butters?,0
"Butters, come out here.",0
"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-",1
"Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny?",2
...Wow.,2
"Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls.",2
Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.,2
Hawaii?,0
"He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.",2
"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.",1
"After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead.",0
"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.",1
"Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more.",2
"""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?",0
We're rich?,0
Blockbuster Video?,0
"Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad.",0
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.,0
I think something might be wrong with Dad?,0
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.,2
"Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?",2
"Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.",2
You'll just have to wait and see.,2
"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.",0
"Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!",0
"Dad, nobody's gonna come.",0
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!,0
"I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!",0
"Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?",1
"I know, but there's nothing I can do.",0
But what about the costume contest?!,1
Stan can't come.,1
Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!,2
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.,0
Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?,1
"No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.",0
"Oh never mind, I hate him again.",0
"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?",1
"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.",1
"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?",1
"How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.",0
"This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!",2
He looks fine.,1
"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.",0
"Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!""",2
Trick or treat.,0
I'm not Bruce Vilanch!,2
The Incredible...,2
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!,2
"The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!",2
JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?!,2
That's right!,2
"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-",1
Dude dude dude! Check it out.,2
What? What's he doing?,0
Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.,1
"You guys, we've gotta stop it!",2
Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!,1
"Hey, where did you guys go?",0
"Oh, sorry dude.",1
"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!",0
Cartman SMASH!,2
For Odin! For Asgard!,1
"Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.",2
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!,0
"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt",0
No no! We weren't gonna go there!,0
"NO!  I won't say anything, I promise!",0
What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!,0
What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.,0
"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?",0
"Oh, ah thank God you found me.",0
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe!,0
"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.",1
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?,2
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.,0
Stan!,1
"Guys, you're okay!",0
What happened to you?,1
"It's all right, just a scratch.",0
"Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!",2
"No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.",0
"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!",1
"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.",0
"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.",0
Oops.,0
"Hey, be careful in there.",0
"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.",0
Wait a minute. There they are!,0
"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are-",0
"It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?!",0
Hey dude.,0
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!,1
"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.",0
You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?,1
"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?",0
Stay gold.,0
I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.,2
"All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU!",2
Did you do it?,1
"Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!",2
"Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?",2
"It's all right, Dad.",0
"So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!",2
"All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.",0
"The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!",2
Yeah I know.,0
"Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!",2
"Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.",0
"I don't know,  I just like it.",0
"Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.",0
...I don't know.  I like it.,0
"No, I just, I don' know. No.",0
I have?,0
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?,0
"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?",0
...Farmers in where?,0
"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?",0
"Wow, this is happening so fast.",0
"My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.",0
No thanks. I'll stand.,0
I'm good.,0
"Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, ""You never took the bracelet off? Not once?""  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground.",0
What are you people talking about?,1
No! This is stupid!,0
No! I never cut if off!,0
Craig?! You asshole!,2
"What's the big idea, Craig?!",0
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!,0
"You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!",0
"And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!",0
"Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!",0
Yeah.,0
"Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.",1
Thanks Kyle.,0
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?,1
Why does it matter?!,0
Because you kind of made it matter.,1
"You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!",0
S-so you did superglue it.,1
"Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!",0
"Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.",1
"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!",0
Jesus!,0
What are you doing here?,0
"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?",0
"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.",0
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.,0
"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.",0
"Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?",0
"NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.",0
"Pff it's like, that's here  and...",0
"Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!",0
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.,0
How can we raise awareness?,0
"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...",0
Our... scause?,0
"Dude, the hell just happen?",0
"Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?",2
"Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!",2
"...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.",2
People are saying that?,0
"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.",0
We did it.,0
"Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.",2
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.,1
Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?!,0
"...Fuck! Dude, weak.",2
"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.",0
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.,0
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.,0
What would Jesus do?  Yeheah!,0
Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?,2
MOM!,2
She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.,2
Mom? Where's my mom?,2
"""Warm nuts"", she said.",2
Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!,2
No way dude. No way.,2
MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!,2
"Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old.",2
MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!,2
"Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?",1
Hey Kyle. What's up?,2
"Nothing, watching the election results.",1
"Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.",2
"Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.",2
"Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!",1
"You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?",2
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.,1
"Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election?",2
Sure you do!,1
"What if I did, Kyle?",2
"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election?",1
"Pretty sweet, huh?",2
What the hell is this?,1
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.,2
"No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.",2
Why do you have these?,1
"Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard.",2
Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate.,2
"Knock it off, Cartman!",1
"Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.",2
"You're not getting away with this, you fat turd!",1
"Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.",2
"Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.",2
"Hmmm, no.",2
"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.",2
"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.",1
Ey! You can't do that! Ey!,2
Upstairs! First door to the left!,1
I know my rights! Stop right now!,2
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!,1
"I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.",2
"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!",1
"But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time.",2
Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!,1
"Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.",0
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!,1
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.,0
"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.",1
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.,0
"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!",1
"Butters, you know something, don't you?!",1
What did Cartman tell you?!,1
Tell us what you know right now!,1
Is that an M&M?,0
Then you have to tell us!,1
Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it!,1
Pry his mouth open!,0
"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!",0
"Mm, mhm, mhm.",2
They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.,2
Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?,2
Can we please just try and talk to him?,1
"Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!",1
"I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!",1
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!,1
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week?,0
"What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!",1
Where?,1
"Oh, Red Lobster.",0
"All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?",1
"Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.",2
"Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!",1
"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?",0
"So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.",2
"Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso.",2
"There's nothing here, Kyle.",0
"Anything in the basement, Jimmy?",1
Well keep looking.,1
"Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.",1
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.,0
"Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship!",0
"Aw shit, it's him again.",0
"Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?",2
"I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.",2
"Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.",2
"Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!",2
"Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!",2
"I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!",2
I want a part in the new movies!,2
I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.,2
"Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.",2
Haha.,2
Haha.,2
"We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-",1
"Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken.",1
I... what?,1
"Well, we tried, dude.",0
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.,1
"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?",0
"It matters, Stan. It it matters.",1
"Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?",0
"Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?",0
Look! There they are!,1
"We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us!",1
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!,1
"I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers!",2
"Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?",2
Protect it?,1
Well... if you put it that way...,1
No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?!,2
"I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!",1
"Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.",2
"Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!""",2
AAAARGH!,1
"Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?",2
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!,1
"Kyle, this is a private conversation.",2
Then take that shit off speaker phone!!,1
"Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.",2
How do we have a choice?!,1
"Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?",2
Who is that? Is that Toby,2
"Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?",2
"You're what? What, you say?",2
"I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""?",2
"See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally!",2
That'd be what?,2
"I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?",2
"Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?",2
"Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?",2
"Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms.",2
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?,1
"Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school",2
"That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle?",2
"Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.",2
"Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!",2
"Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.",2
"No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.",2
"What, they already have something better than Twitter?",2
No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?,2
What the hell are you doing?!,1
Wow.,0
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?,1
"Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.",2
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.,2
"Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?",2
Bill Clinton.,2
"Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.",2
"I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.",2
"I was um, sure that the appointment was today.",2
Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.,2
"Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?",2
Really? How big is my file?,2
"Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.",2
"Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet.""  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!",2
"Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!",2
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!,2
Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!,2
I don't know.,2
Get their hands on what?  Dude...,2
"You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!",2
You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!,2
"It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!",2
Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?!,2
"It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa!",2
I do toooo!,2
"Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.",2
"...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?",2
"It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.",2
I can be forgiven?,2
For everything bad I've ever done?,2
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?,2
Thta's pretty kewl.,2
"I do, I love my country!",2
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!,2
"Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!",2
"Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.",2
"Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!",2
"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.",2
That's more like it.,2
You guys are watchin' murder porn?,0
Okaaay.,0
What's up dude?,0
"Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?",2
"Yhh, yeah, the first grader?",0
You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.,2
...What?!,0
What happened?,0
"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!",1
Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!,2
"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.",1
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff.,0
What? How do you know?,1
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?,0
"You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.",2
Butters' dad killed his mom.,2
"Butters, what happened?",0
"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?",0
In Minecraft.,0
That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!,1
Whattaya mean?,0
Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft.,1
"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!",1
"Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too!",2
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!,1
"And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!",2
"Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.",2
"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see.",0
"Alright, we've gotta do something.",2
Corey Lanskin?,1
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.,1
"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!",0
"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.",1
"What, dude?",0
"Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!""",2
"You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.",2
Aha!,0
Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!,2
"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!",0
So you know it.,1
"We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.",1
"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.",1
"No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.",0
"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?",0
Can we talk to your supervisor please?!,1
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.,0
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?,1
"Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!",1
"No, that's way too long!",0
"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?",0
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.,0
I... said it would really bum them out.,0
"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.",0
"Hey Token!  What's up, bro?",2
"""Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?",2
"Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?",2
"Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time.",2
Is he doing it again?,0
He's doing it a-gain.,1
"Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out?",2
"God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro.",2
"Cartman, are you feeling alright?",0
"Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong?",2
"Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump?",2
It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.,2
He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.,2
"But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!",2
"No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.",2
M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.,2
M'kay.,2
"No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!",2
Hey Token? How are you doing?,2
That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump.,2
"No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!",2
No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO!,2
"Hoh boy, here we go.",2
"Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?",2
"This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.",2
"I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict.",2
"It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.",2
"Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.",2
It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.,2
Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho!,2
"Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!""",2
"Token, calm down.",2
Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now!,2
"Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go!",2
Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!,2
Get to an airport!,2
"We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!!",2
The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!,2
Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God!,2
The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now!,2
The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!,2
You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to!,2
Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland.,2
Everyone quiet! I have to think!,2
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet.,2
Nah!,2
One of them is in the back!,2
"Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!",2
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.,2
His name is Token.,2
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!,2
Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.,2
We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!,2
Come on!,2
Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.,2
A person.,2
Threatening all of us!,2
What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!,2
Stand my ground?,2
"Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!",2
"This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?",2
The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!,2
"Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!",2
"If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.",2
Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out.,2
I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.,2
"Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.",2
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.,0
"Yeah, that sucked.",1
Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.,2
"Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.",2
"Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.",2
"Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person.",2
"That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it.",2
Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.,2
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?,1
Yeah. So bad.,2
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?,1
"Jury found me innocent, Kyle!",2
You're a murderer.,1
You interrupt people when they talk.,2
Oh man!,2
Oh boy.,2
"Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.",2
"Oh God, here we go again!",2
"That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.",2
"Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.",1
"I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.",1
"Hey Ike, how's it going?",1
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.,1
"Ike, I just want us to be friends again.",1
"Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.",1
It always has been. See? This is nice.,1
"Ike, is that chewing tobacco?",1
"No, I just don't think it's healthy.",1
"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?",1
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-,1
Right now.,1
"He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.",1
"Yeah, he just seems so young.",1
"Let's just give it a chance, Ike.",1
What the fuck is going on?!,1
"I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!",1
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?,0
He doesn't even let me near him!,1
"That sucks, dude.",2
"I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.",2
"Oh, thanks!",1
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.,1
Hey Ike.,1
"Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.",1
"I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.",1
"Ike, I do! I just-",1
Ike no! Stop!,1
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.,1
That's what I thought.,1
"Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.",1
"I'm your big brother, Ike!",1
"I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-",1
Hey!,1
"Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!",1
"No, this is his brother.",1
Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!,1
"Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!",1
"Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!",1
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?,1
"I dunno!  Try ""strangetamer.""",1
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!,1
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!,1
"Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!",1
Ike!  Wait! ',1
"Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.",1
"Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!",1
"Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.",1
"It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?",1
"Yeah, I bet she does.",1
"Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.",2
About what?!,1
"I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.",2
Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?,2
"There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow.",2
"You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!",2
"Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature!",2
"Alright, Cartman, joke's over.",1
What? What joke? This is real!,2
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!,1
"No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.",2
"Thank you, Butters!",2
"Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.",2
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.,1
"Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh.",2
Nothing.,1
Wuwhat's going on?,1
I don't speak Hebrew.,1
He said they come on urgent business.,1
"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!",1
It's right over here by uh-,1
He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!,1
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-,1
"Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.""",2
"Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!",1
"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles.",2
NOOOO!,1
Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?,2
Yeah.,1
"I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.",2
No shit!,1
"I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.",2
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.,1
"No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!",2
"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!",1
"But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.",2
"Dude, go to Hell!",1
"You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it!",2
Wwwait.,1
Mom?,1
"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.",1
"You're a fat skank, Mom.",1
"Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??",2
"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue.",1
"Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?",2
"Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle.",2
How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?,0
I just... thought it'd be nice.,1
"Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle?",2
Yes sir.,1
"Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?",2
Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.,1
You what??,2
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.,1
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?,1
"Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.",2
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.,1
Let's see. Oh! Oh!,2
Yummy yummy thank you Cartman.,1
"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?",1
Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.,1
Because they taste so yummy.,1
"Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?",2
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.,1
"Kyle, are you sure?",2
Please...,1
Well alright.,2
Yummy yummy.,1
Hey Kyle.,0
Hey,1
"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.",0
"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.",1
"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?",0
"I just do, Stan.",1
You like... how they smell? How they taste?,0
They're really that good?,0
Should I try them?,0
NO.,1
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?,1
"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?",2
I don't care.,1
"I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?",2
That's fine.,1
"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.",0
"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.",1
"I don't get it, Kenny.",0
"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.",0
"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more.",1
Huh? Who...? Who is that?,1
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.,1
I... I know.,1
"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.",1
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.,1
"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle?",2
Yes! Yes I will!,1
Huh? You comin'?,2
"Yes, whatever you want.",1
Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow.,2
"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.",0
"It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you.",1
"Hello, Stan.",1
"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.",0
There are greater things at work than what you understand.,1
"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.",0
I'm actually the complete opposite.,1
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!,0
"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.",1
See? You sound like a dick.,0
I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!,1
"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.",0
"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!",1
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.,0
"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!",0
"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?",2
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?,1
"Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.",2
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.,1
"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?",0
Dude! Do not do this!,1
"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!",0
"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!",1
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.,0
"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!",1
"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!",0
"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!",1
"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!""",0
"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.",1
You should apologize to Kenny too.,0
"I'm sorry, Kenny!",1
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.,0
Hurray!,1
Small penis?!,2
"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!",1
Yes! It did!,1
"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!",1
"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.",2
But it's the truth!,1
"No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.",2
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.,1
"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up?",2
"Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.",2
"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.",2
"Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.",2
What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.,2
"I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.",2
"It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!",2
It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?,0
"On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.",2
"Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.",2
"They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.",2
"Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!",2
The House of Greyhawk?,0
Larry and Brad Stoltsky,1
"But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?",2
"Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.",2
"Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?",2
What do you mean?,2
"Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.",2
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us!,2
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!,1
"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.",2
"...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.",2
"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.",1
"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.",1
"No, the XBox's are gonna be better.",1
"We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!",2
"Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!",2
"Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!",2
"No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?",1
I like the PS4's controller better.,0
"Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.",1
"The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.",0
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.,1
"If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.",0
"Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality.",2
"Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?",2
God these guys are such dorks!,2
"Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?",2
"Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.",2
"The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?",2
"You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.",2
"Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.",2
"This isn't helping us, Butters!",1
What new Elmo doll?,2
"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?",0
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!,0
"No, you can't do that!",0
"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.",0
Exactly!,0
"...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!",0
"Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.",2
"I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.",2
"True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.",2
"You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?",2
"Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!",2
And who do we have on our side?,0
Did you ask the Vamp kids?,0
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side.,0
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?,0
"Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?",2
"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?",1
"Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.",2
"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess!",0
"Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot!",2
"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training!",2
"Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.",1
"The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.",2
"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.",1
"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!""",2
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.,1
"I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game.",2
"Stupid asshole!  Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.  Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!",2
"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick",2
"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?",2
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?,2
So what happens when the dragons show up?,2
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.,2
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.,2
"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.",2
Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!,2
Why don't you mind your own business?!,2
"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.",2
"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.",1
"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?",2
Grounded? For what?,1
That could be up to you.,2
"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!",1
"Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?",2
"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.",2
"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!",2
Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!,2
"Hi, is Kenny home?",2
"Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me.",2
"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?",2
Let them pass!,0
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.,0
"You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.",2
"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.",0
"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!",2
The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.,0
That doesn't even make sense.,2
"Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.",1
What I started? How dare you!,0
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?,1
"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!",0
"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?!",2
The gods will find us a way!,0
"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.",2
"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.",2
Your CEOs?,2
"Uhhh, hmmm. What?",2
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!,2
He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??,2
"Because, because what? Because he's cute?",2
"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!",1
But what does he do besides that he's cute?!,2
"Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit.",2
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!,1
"He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!",2
"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!",1
"So what are you saying, Kyle?!",2
"I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.",1
"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here.",0
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.,0
I have no idea.,0
Yes?,0
What?,0
"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.",1
"Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?",2
"Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.",2
"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.",1
"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own.",0
"We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.",2
"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.",1
"Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.",1
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?,0
"I swear, Stan.",1
"Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan.",0
"Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.",2
"Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.",2
"Yeah, sure, what about it?",0
"I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors.",2
"Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.",2
"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.",0
"Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-",2
Dude! Dude!,2
"Dude, shut the fuck up!",2
Who is that?,0
He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.,2
"God damn it, shut up!",2
"Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!",2
Did Kyle know about this?,0
"Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.",2
Did Kyle know about this?!,0
"Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!",2
I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!,2
"Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?",2
"Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.",2
"Yesh, kewl.",2
"Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.",2
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?,2
"Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!",1
"Yes, he did.",2
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!,1
"It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.",2
What the hell did you do??,1
"What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!",2
No. Tell me you didn't!,1
"Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.",1
Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?,1
Huh? Hello? Who is that?,0
"Stan, it's me.",1
Get out of here!,0
"Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.",1
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.,0
"You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.",1
"I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!",0
You didn't?,1
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.,0
"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.",1
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.,0
"Stan, don't say that.",1
Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out!,0
"Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?",2
"Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.",2
Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?,2
"Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality!",1
What the hell is this?!,2
"I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!",1
"Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!",2
"I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!",1
"Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!",2
"The fight is over, Cartman!",1
"Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!",2
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?,1
They're not a part of your betrayal?,2
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?,1
No. Whose betrayal is this?,2
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!,0
"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!",0
"Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.",2
"Yay, XBox wins.",2
Yay.,0
We'd like to get XBox Ones please.,2
"The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.",2
"Yes, it is.",0
You guys wanna p-play outside or something?,2
"Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?",1
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.,2
"Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?",0
"The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?",2
"Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!",2
Fuck 'em!,2
"You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?",2
Uh oh.,2
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.,2
"Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.",2
"Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today.",2
"Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.",0
"Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.",0
She looks pretty hot here.,0
"Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.",2
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!,1
"Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.",2
"Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?",0
"A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.",0
"Wendy, why is it such a big deal?",0
I do?,0
"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.",1
"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.",1
Yes!,1
Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?,1
"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!",1
Well what are you watching?,1
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?,1
"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?",1
"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.",1
"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.",1
"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?",2
"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!",1
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.,1
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.,0
"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.",1
"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?!",1
"Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.",2
"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.",2
Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.,2
"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.",1
There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!,2
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-,1
"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.",2
"Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?",1
"More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.",2
"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!",1
What the fuck?!,1
"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!",1
"God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!",2
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?,1
What do you think you're doing?!,1
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.,2
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!,1
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.,2
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!,1
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!,1
"Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.",2
Let's Plays?,1
"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times.",2
"Hey, what's up?",0
You're not gonna believe this.,1
"Oh no, what now?",0
"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.",1
Come on!,1
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.,1
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.,1
"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!",2
"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!",0
Grandpa?,0
"This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!",1
"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!",0
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!,0
CartmaaanBrah!,2
"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.",2
"CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.",2
"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?",0
It's dying. The living room is... dying.,1
"Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.",2
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.,1
Tell me about it.,0
"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!",2
"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.",1
Oh God.,2
Do you mind?!,1
"Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated",2
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!,1
"Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!",2
"What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-",1
"Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.",2
It's Cartman's stupid online persona!,1
Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!,2
"This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.",2
"Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.",2
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-,1
There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.,2
"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!",1
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!,1
"This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.",2
What the hell did I do?,2
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.,2
Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.,2
"Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!",2
"Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!",2
Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.,2
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.,0
Barking vaginal belch.,1
Protruding vaginal boner.,2
"Oh, I like that.",2
Nah.,0
Bloody butt cough.,1
Uh huh.,0
Angry Clit Spasm,0
Whooping Fart Balls.,0
Lubricated Titty Burgers.,0
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!,0
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!,2
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!,1
"Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!",2
It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.,1
"Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.",0
"No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.",0
"No, we don't wanna do anything.",0
"Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.",1
"...Nnnno, there isn't.",0
"You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!",2
It's the greatest startup company name EVER!,2
What?! Tell us!,1
Washington. Redskins.,2
Washington Redskins?,1
It's sooo sweet!,2
"I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.",0
"It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!",2
Washington Redskins.  I like it!,0
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!,2
"Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.",1
"Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!",2
You alright dude?,0
"Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original",1
"It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.",2
"Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.",1
"We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.",2
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.,1
What?!,0
"I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention!",2
"Sittin' on our asses, here we come!",2
"By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.",2
"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.",2
"Yes, I know.",2
"Oh, cool. Please take a seat.",2
"Nice, I like that.",2
Stop? But why?,2
"Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?",2
How is it offensive?,2
"Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people.",2
"Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself.",2
"Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!",2
"Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.",1
"Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!",2
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!,1
"Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!",2
That's the Catholic Church!,1
"NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!",2
That's the NFL!,1
"It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.",2
"All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.",1
"Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!",2
Maybe I'll start my own company.,1
"Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!""",2
I don't want to! It's a stupid name!,1
"Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?",2
Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.,1
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?,2
"I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.",0
"Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye.",2
"Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins!",2
"It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!",1
Yeah...,0
"You okay, bro?",1
"I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC.""",0
"Give it time, it'll grow on you.",1
"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?",0
"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!",1
"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.",0
Well whattaya mean?,1
"I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.",0
"Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back.",1
"Good luck with your company, dude.",0
Yeah. Good luck with yours.,1
"Goooood morning, guys!",2
"We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!",2
"What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!",2
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!,2
"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter.",1
You song of a bitch!,2
You broke Kickstarter!,2
"No, I just can't get it to load.",1
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!,2
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!,1
"Well, somebody did!",2
"It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.",0
He's right. We should do a merger.,1
"A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything!",2
"Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.",1
It is really sweet.,2
"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,",0
"Whattaya say, Cartman?",1
"Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.",2
"When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.",1
"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo.",2
"Boy, this is the life, huh guys?",0
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch.,2
What the heck is that?,1
"Whoa, whoa! What?",2
Change our name?,1
But you all thought our name was sweet.,0
When was that?,1
Well what the hell do we do?,1
I guess we gotta go back to school.,2
Hey guys!,1
Morning!,0
"How's it going, everybody?",2
"Sup, Jason?",1
Hey dude. Sup?,2
What do you mean? We're just... going to school.,2
"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.",1
"Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-",2
We were- trying to be funny.,1
Hey Wendy.,0
"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.",0
"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.",0
"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.",0
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says?,0
"Dude, people are pissed off at us.",2
"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?",1
"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?",2
"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.",1
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.,1
"You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party",2
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!,2
"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.",1
"Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.",2
"Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.",1
"Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...",2
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!,0
"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.",1
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!,2
"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?",1
"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.",0
"Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.",2
So who do we throw the party for?,2
"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down.",0
"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.",1
"You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.",2
"You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.",2
"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.",0
"""I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes.""",2
"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!",1
"Believe it, dude.",2
Sweet!,0
Excuse me?,0
What the hell is gluten?,2
"Wait, wait, ah I might need those.",0
Hey Cartman.,1
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!,2
"Dude, calm down.",1
"THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!",2
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?,1
KYYYLE!,2
"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.",1
What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.,2
We can't let our party suck.,0
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.,2
"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?",1
I'll be back.,0
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.,2
"Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.",1
"There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.",2
Dad? Dad!,0
"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?",0
"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?",0
"Nonono, not yet. DAD!",0
"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!",0
Let me talk to my dad!,0
Aunt Jemima.,2
"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.",2
I don't even know what that means.,2
Are you going to eat those pancakes?,2
"Oooo, trippy...",2
They've got what backward?,2
"Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.",2
"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.",0
"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!",1
"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-",0
"Jesus Christ, dude.",1
"Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...",0
"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!",0
"KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!",2
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.,2
"What, what is it? What is it for?",2
It's upside down.,2
"Sir, the pyramid is upside down.",2
"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.",1
"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us.",1
"Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.",2
"Yeah yeah, enjoy the party.",2
"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?",0
"Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.",0
What does that mean?,0
"Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will!",2
"Are you okay, Cartman?",1
"Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.",2
Good for you.,2
No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!,2
"I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!",2
Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!,2
"Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!",1
"Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this!",2
I'm going to the potty.,2
"Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.",2
"Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!",2
"Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys.",2
"Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.",2
"It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too.",2
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.,2
"Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.",2
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.,2
Erica.,2
"All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.",2
"There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.",2
"Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.",2
"Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.",2
"I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem.",2
"Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?",2
OH MY GOD!,2
"Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.",2
"Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.",2
Oh on that side?,2
"Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.",2
Cartman's a girl now?,0
"It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!",2
"Yup! You know what Hillary says: ""You can suck my clit and balls.""",2
"Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!",2
"Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!",2
"I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!",2
"Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!",2
Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!,2
"No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!",2
Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!,2
"Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you!",2
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.,0
"Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?",0
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.,0
"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?",0
"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.",0
"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.",0
...I don't know where I belong...,0
"Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!",2
Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!,2
"I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.",0
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!,2
"Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!",2
"At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!",2
"Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!",2
I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded.,2
To the bathroom?,0
"Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah",0
"Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?",2
"Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!",2
No it isn't.,2
That's stupid.,2
I'm dying of boredom.,2
What did you say?,2
Your dad has a fucking drone?,2
Whooaa!,2
You wanna take it out for a spin?,2
Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!,2
"Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.",2
"Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!",2
"Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.",2
"Butters, is that you?",2
"Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!",2
"Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it.",2
"It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic!",2
"Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!",2
"Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.",2
"Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!",2
"This thing is recording, right?",2
"Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail!",2
His dad sees you!,2
"Fly back to the house, stupid!",2
"Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!",2
"Not a word, Kenny!",2
"Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?",0
"Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.",1
I know.,0
Hey you guys.,2
Sup?,0
You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?,2
"Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out?",2
"That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.",1
You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.,2
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.,1
Let me see.,0
"Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.",2
How'd you get that on your phone?,0
"Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?",2
That's terrible!,1
"I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.",2
"Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.",2
Butters-,2
Butters. Butters.,2
"Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!",2
"Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!",2
"Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass!",2
Are you happy now?!,1
What?,2
"Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?",1
What does that have to do with me?,2
"See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!",1
"Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.",2
"I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-",1
You were what?!,2
I was in the bathroom-,1
You were spying on me?!,2
"No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!",1
"But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!",2
How is that spying?!,1
"You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy!",2
"Because, Butters-",2
"Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.",2
"Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.""",2
"Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!",2
Oh hey Butters. Sup?,2
"Dude, what's the matter?",2
"Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here.",2
"Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.",2
"Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.",2
"Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.",2
Your dad's drone.,2
"Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!",2
"Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.",2
"It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom.",2
"Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  ""Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass.""",2
"Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.",2
You're welcome.,2
Hey Jimmy. What's up?,1
Oh. Really?,1
"Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.",1
This is stupid!,1
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!,1
What are you two boners doing?,2
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.,2
Who makes this crap?,1
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.,0
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.,0
"I'll pay you back for it, okay?!",0
"I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!",0
Ohhh hey guys.,0
You... missed school today?,1
"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.",0
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?,1
"Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?",0
"How much money did you micropay today, Stan?",2
"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto.",0
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?,1
"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?",0
"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.",0
"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?",1
Jimmy told me about this game.,2
"Kenny, who told you about this game?",1
"Dude, what?!",1
The?!,2
"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?",1
You need to stop recommending that app to people!,1
Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!,2
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!,2
"Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!",1
You just push it on other people?!,1
"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!",1
It's just...,0
"Yeah, it's fun.",0
"Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.",0
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!,1
How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.,2
And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!,2
You have your crutches!,1
That makes sense.,2
You're saging these games do this on purpose?!,1
...Free?,0
"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.",0
One?,0
"No, no, it's not.",0
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!,0
"Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.",0
"Sure. Come on, guys.",1
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.,0
"We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-",1
It's done.,2
"Wuh, what's done?",1
"The word is out.  ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it.  It's trending.",2
"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way?",0
"Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.",0
So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?,0
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?,0
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.,0
"Yeah, no, this is great.",0
"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?",0
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications.,0
"Ah, Canada?",0
...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!,0
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me.,0
Hey dude.,1
Hey.,0
Y-you alright?,1
"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.",0
"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.",0
"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.",0
"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.",0
"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies.",0
"Butters, what the hell are you doing?",0
"That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now?",2
"Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.",2
"Butters, no! Are you crazy?!",2
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??,2
"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!",2
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??,2
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!,2
"Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!",2
"Welcome back, dude.",2
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?,2
"And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back.""  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!",2
Sound pretty typical to me.,0
"Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!",2
"Coup de grah, Cartman",1
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?,0
"Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!",2
"Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.",2
"Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?",2
See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.,2
"Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?",2
Even 10% is good enough. Here you go.,2
"Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?",2
"Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark.",2
"All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.",2
"Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.",2
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.,2
"Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.",2
"Just take the money, Butters!",2
"You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.",2
"Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.",2
"Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.",2
"Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.",2
"Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?",2
"Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?",2
"Wait, hang on Butters!",2
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!,2
Butters?? Butters??,2
Butters.,2
Are you okay?,2
"I'm not here, Butters.",2
"This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.",2
"Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality.",2
"You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam.",2
"Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.",2
How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door?,2
"I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet!",2
"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!",1
I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?,2
With what?,2
"You should probably listen to him, dude.",1
"Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.",2
"Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.",2
Maybe we are.,1
"Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.",2
Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you!,2
Are you fucking with me?!,2
"Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!",2
"Because if you are, it's not cool!",2
"Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!",2
"Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!",2
"THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?",2
Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER!,2
Again?,1
Uh huh.,1
"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.",1
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?,1
Fuck you!,1
"Get up, Cartman!",1
"Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!",1
"Kyle, maybe this is for real.",0
Fuck you if you're in on this.,1
"In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!",0
"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.",1
"Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.",1
Kyle.,1
I don't care!,1
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!,1
"""Fuck you"" what?",0
He said they're doing a Total Recall.,1
Oh fuck you!,0
You haven't done anything yet!,1
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!,1
"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool.",2
"Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.",1
I know. Let's go to the backyard.,2
"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.",1
Okay Kyle.,2
"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.",1
"Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?",2
"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.",1
Mmmhmm.,2
"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.",1
"And why did the guys send you, Kyle?",2
Www-what do you mean?,1
"Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.",2
"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.",2
Don't... do that!,1
Calm down.,2
"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-",1
"In virtual reality, yes you did.",2
No. Then I came into this virtual space.,1
"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!",2
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!,1
Fuck!,2
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?,1
Or if I did?,2
"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?",1
Dude... What?,1
What?  Hello?,2
Dude. NOW this is getting weird!,2
"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help!",0
"Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?",1
"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.",0
"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-",1
"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.",0
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.,1
"No, you guys. This is virtual reality.",2
How do you know?,0
Because... I'm a computer program.,2
"I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.",2
He's lying.,1
I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.,2
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?,0
Butters called Customer Service first?,0
"Come on, we're going to Butters' house!",0
Why not?,1
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!,1
So now we are in th real world.,0
"You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!",2
"Yes, we're here.",0
Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?,0
What?!,0
That doesn't make sense!,0
"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?",0
We're right here dude. Do you remember now?,1
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point.,0
"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?",0
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.,1
"Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.",0
"Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer.",2
"Alright, dude, take off the headset.",1
"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?",1
"It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.",0
"Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.",2
"Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.",2
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.,1
"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball.",0
"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.",2
Can Kenny block his elderbeast?,1
Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.,0
This asshole needs to make a move already!,2
Shhh!,0
What's that?,0
He's playing an enchantment.,2
This late?,0
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!,1
"Dude, it was complete brutality!",2
You've never seen anything so ruthless!,1
It was seriously almost hard to watch.,0
"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!",2
"Wendy, did you hear about last night?",0
Not that. Did you actually go to that?,0
Pfft whatever.,0
"Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!",2
"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.",2
We're men.,0
Kewwwl!,2
"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.",1
What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp?,2
It doesn't even look like they're open.,1
"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?",0
"Dude, do we look like police?",2
Five darrar?,2
"Dude, that was total carnage!",2
That was freakin' hardcore.,0
Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?,2
It was just decimation.,0
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.,1
"We're going again on Friday, right?",2
Hell yeah!,0
What's the matter Kenny?,2
What's mean about it?,0
You feel bad for the roosters?,2
"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.",0
"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.",1
"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.",2
Huh? A little bit?,2
"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.",0
"Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!",1
"What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys.",2
"Dad, it's not that big a deal.",0
You were?,1
"Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.",0
"Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?",2
"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.",1
We don't... really know the difference.,1
Do you think they're happy?,0
"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?",0
"Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?",2
"Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?",2
"Hey, how about this little guy?",0
Then he's perfect for us.,1
"What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""?",2
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?,1
"""Yes I do, you guys.""  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?",2
"You can do it, McNuggets!",1
All right McNuggets!,2
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!,1
"That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls volleyball.",2
Thank you so very much.,2
You mean there's more to this?,1
"Gee, thanks!",0
"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!",2
"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.",0
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.,1
"We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.",2
"Yeah, you gotta know people.",1
"Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.",2
"Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.",0
OOHHH!!,2
"Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.",2
This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.,1
"Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time.",2
"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.",2
Ten darra?!,2
Who is that??,2
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?,0
"Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!",2
McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.,1
"McNuggets is scared, dude!",2
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!,0
"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.",1
This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.,2
"Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!",2
"Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.",2
"Come on, Kenny!",1
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?,0
"Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.",2
He just had to shuffle it.,1
Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.,2
Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?!,0
"Holy shit, dude!",1
"Ah, dude, your dad's here.",2
"It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.",2
"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.",1
"Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?",2
"Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?",1
"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.",0
Got what?,1
A way to finally do something good for other people.,0
"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.",1
"Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!",2
"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-",1
I'm NOT a GRANDPA!,1
"But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom",1
Whattaya think?,1
Really??,1
"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome.""",1
"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.",1
Bill Cosby.,1
Is here. To see me.,1
Hello.,1
We?,1
Wow.  Well that's awesome!,1
"M-Ah, I'd love to.",1
Uh okay! No problem!,1
"Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!",1
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.,0
"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!",1
Who did?,0
"These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!",1
"That's a little strange, isn't it?",0
"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!",1
"CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?",2
"Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.",1
He's such a douchebag.,2
Now we're talkin'!,2
That son of a bitch!,1
That self-promoting asshole!,0
Why would he do this?!,1
Because my dad's an idiot!,0
"Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!",1
"Nnnothing, nothing.",0
"Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now.",2
"Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.",2
"No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!",2
"I can hear you, douchebag.",2
These guys are such blumpkin catchers.,2
G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!,2
Mom?! Where is Ike?!,1
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!,1
"Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!",1
"We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!",0
WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!,1
"Yeah, you damn kids!",0
"Cartman, open this door right now!",1
"Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!",2
"What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.",2
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!,1
How do you even know I'm here in my room?,2
"Because you just said, ""here in my room""!",1
"...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws.",2
"Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!",0
Why does that matter?,2
"Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.",0
"What are you talking about, Stan?",1
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.,0
"Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah.",2
"Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.",1
It just all seemed so... stupid.,0
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.,1
"Oh, this should be good.",2
I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.,2
"Hoh, this should get some comments.",2
"Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.",1
"Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.",0
What??,0
"Oh bros, weak!",2
"Oh weak, bros, so weak!",2
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?,1
Dude. You're such a grandpa.,0
"Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?  This looks pretty stupid.",2
CartmaanBrah!,2
"Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!",2
"Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.",2
"Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.",2
"Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.",2
I am so confused.,1
"I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.",2
It's all CartmanBrah now.  I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender.  Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!,2
"Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.",1
Help? How can you help?,1
Really? That's what you guys would do?,1
"Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!",1
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear!,1
Hey! What's going on? What is that?,2
What the hell?!,2
PewDiePie?!,1
"Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!",2
"Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!",2
Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...,2
No! You can't do this!,2
"God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!",2
NOOOO!,2
"Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.",1
"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.",0
"Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.",1
"No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.",1
"Yeah, I think that's great too.",0
"Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.",1
"Ike, you can't come to school with me.",1
"Yeah, go home you little dildo.",2
"Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!",1
What's a dildo?,0
"Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!",1
I know what it means!,2
"Well, what?",1
I'm not telling you.,2
"What's a dildo, Kenny?",0
"He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  Ow!",2
"Dude, that kicks ass!",0
"Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!",1
Kick the baby.,1
"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.",0
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.,2
Really? What about?,1
"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.  Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open,  and the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.  Then I was lying on a table,  and these scary hands wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes...",2
Dude! Visitors!,0
Totally!,1
"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!",0
"No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.",2
Visitors are real.,0
"Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.",1
"Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.",2
"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?",0
Kick ass.,2
"Yeah, fat boy saw it!",1
"Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!",2
Oh!,2
They took him on their ship.,0
What's an anal probe?,1
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?,1
"No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?",2
"Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!",0
"Shut up, dildo!",2
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.,1
"God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!",2
Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?,1
Shut up!,2
"No, Ike, go home.",1
This is it. This one's for the game.,1
Kick the baby!,1
"Good morning, Miss Crabtree.",0
"Damn it, he's still there.",1
"Oh, don't worry about him.",0
"No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.",1
Ike! Go home!,1
"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.",0
I said I have a bad itch.,0
"Oh, my God!",1
Visitors!,0
"Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!",1
But I have to get off!,1
But I...,1
Arrghh!,1
"Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?",0
"Shut up you guys, it's not working.",2
"I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!",1
"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.",0
"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.",0
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted.,1
Somebody's baking brownies.,2
"Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?""",1
"Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.",0
"""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?""",1
"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.",1
"No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.",1
"Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.",2
"Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?",1
"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!",1
"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?",1
Damn it!,1
"Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.  Ow! My ass!",2
"Damn, Cartman!",0
Uh... Ow! My ass!,2
"Dude, he's farting fire!",1
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!,0
"No, that was just a dream.",2
"No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.",2
"Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.",2
How can you eat when you're farting fire?,0
"Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.",2
"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.",1
Where?,0
Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger,2
"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!",0
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.,2
I do not!,0
Bleech!,0
"Dude, what does the note say?",1
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.,0
Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.,1
Or slip her the tongue.,2
What? How do you know she has a cat?,0
"Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.",1
Bad.,1
"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?",1
"Uh, Chef.",0
Chef.,0
Chef!,0
Chef!!,0
Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.,0
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.,1
You are making it up.,2
Whoa!,0
That was cool!,1
"Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?",2
"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.",1
"Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!",2
"Killer! Thanks, Chef.",0
"Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!",2
"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.",0
"I would if I could, you son of a bitch!",2
"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?",1
"Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control! 
I love to singa
About the moona and June-a and the springa
I love to singa
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...",2
What the hell was that?,0
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!,1
"Ah, son of a bitch!",2
"You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.",2
Uh...,2
If you visitors can hear me-,1
Hey...,2
"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!",1
"Ow!  That hurts, you buttlicker!",2
"Kyle, look! It's them.",0
Give me back my brother!,1
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!,0
"You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!",1
"Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.",0
Owww.,0
"Wow, poor Kenny.",0
"Now do you believe us, Cartman?",1
"Cartman, they killed Kenny!",1
He's not dead.,2
"Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?",0
"Shut up, you guys.",2
"He's dead, Cartman!",1
"God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.",2
"Go on and go home, you fat chicken!",1
Dildo!,2
"You're all I have left, Stan.",1
"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.",0
"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!",1
"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot.",0
Rats.,1
"Hi, Mom.",2
"Well, I'm pissed off!",2
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!,2
That's what I said.,2
"No, Mom, leave me alone!",2
"What? Well, that does sound pretty good.  Uh, Mom?",2
"If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?",2
"Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.",2
"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.",1
But her note said she'd be here.,0
"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.",1
"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?",1
Just make sweet love down by the fire.,1
"Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.",2
"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.",2
"No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!",2
"No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!  Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!",2
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.,1
"Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman.",1
"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?",0
"No, Kitty, you can't have any!",2
"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!  Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.",2
"Dude, weak mom.",2
"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.",1
"I can't, my mom said...",2
"But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--",2
God damn it!,2
"You guys, I have to get home.",2
"Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.",0
"Oh, man, this sucks.",2
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?,1
I think we have to signal them somehow.,0
Ow!,2
"Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!",1
"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.",2
"Come on Cartman, fart!",0
I don't wanna.,2
He can't hold it in forever.,0
"Fart, damn you!",1
"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!  I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.",2
"Hey, it's happening again.",0
"Whoa, look at that.",1
"Now, do you believe this, Cartman?",0
You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.,2
"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!",0
"Sure, you guys, what-ever.",2
"You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!  Oh, God damn it!",2
"Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...",1
"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.",0
"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.",1
"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.",1
"That was beautiful, dude.",0
Did it work?,1
"No, they're leaving.",0
"Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!",1
"Whoa, dude!",0
You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!,1
"Hey Wendy, what's a dildo?",0
"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!",1
"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!",1
What the hell are they talking about?,2
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!,1
"You guys, get me down from here!  Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!",2
"Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.",0
"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.",1
"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner.",1
"Thanks for your help, Wendy.",0
"Hey, I didn't throw up.",0
Bleech!,0
Sorry.,0
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.,0
"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.",0
I don't know what the hell that is...,0
"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.",0
"Yeh, we're running out of friends.",1
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.,0
Puh!,2
"Oh, hey Cartman.",0
"Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.",1
"Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.",2
"Really, what about?",0
"Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.",2
"That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.",0
Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?,2
"Cartman, you do have pinkeye!",1
"Ahh, son of a bitch!",2
"Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?",1
"Yeah, it was huge.",0
"Heh, I hate those things.",2
Nobody hates rainbows.,1
"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?",0
"Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, ""Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!""",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?",0
"I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!",2
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.,1
"Ohh, rainbows. Yeah, I like those, those are cool.",2
What were you talking about?,0
"Heh, oh, nothing, forget it.",2
"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?",1
Nothing..!,2
Kick ass!,2
"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.",0
"Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.",2
"Wow, what did you write about Cartman?",1
"Oh, you know, this and that.",2
What was your paper about Wendy?,1
"There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.",2
"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.",0
"Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?",2
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?,1
"You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.",2
"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.",0
"Wow, are you gonna do it?",1
"Yeah, that'd be cool.",0
That kid is me.,2
Me! Eric Cartman!,2
"Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.",2
"...I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television...",2
"We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.",0
"Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.",2
"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.",0
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.,2
Dolphins are way smarter than you!,0
"If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?",2
"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!",0
"Dolphins, eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!",2
Tell me what you wrote about!,0
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.,2
"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!",0
"Screw you, hippie!",2
"Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.",2
Beefcake!,2
BEEFCAKE!,2
"Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?",2
"But mom, I need it for tomorrow.",2
"Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!",2
Hey dudes.,2
"What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?",1
"Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?",2
What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.,0
"I'm up to 94, thank you very much.",2
"Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's.",1
"Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.",2
What's that stuff?,0
"Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.",2
"Bulk up to what, fatass?",1
Superfatass?,0
"Hey, I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!  Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.",2
Take that you stupid Indian!,0
"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.",1
"Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.",2
"You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!",1
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!,2
"Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!""",1
"No they don't, you jealous weakling!",2
"Oh look, another hippie.  Peace, Wendy.",2
Shut up Cartman!,0
"Oooh, Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...",2
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!,2
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.,1
Stop who?,1
"Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.",2
"You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.",2
"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?",0
"Uh oh, we're losing him.",1
"Wendy, look!",0
"Cartman, God damn it.",2
"Mr. Garrison, stop!",0
"Here it is, my big moment of fame.",2
"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?",0
"Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!",1
"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play.",1
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?,2
But I won the environmental essay contest.,2
"Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?",0
"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.",0
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.,0
"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.",1
When is this going to be on the air?,2
"Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!",2
"Okay, Mom.",2
"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?",1
"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?",0
"Dude, that's sick mom.",2
"Drive, Drive!",2
"Drive the car damn-it, drive!",2
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.,1
"Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.",2
"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.",0
"You piece of crap, I'll kill you!",2
Eeeh!,2
"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.",0
I like chocolate milk.,1
"Hey, I didn't get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam",2
"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.",0
"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.",0
"Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.",2
"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.",0
"Wow, that'd be cool.",1
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.,2
"Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.",0
What do you mean?,1
Democrats piss me off!,2
"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.",0
Kickass!!,2
Is this hunting?,0
"Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.",2
"Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!",2
Shoot it Stan.,1
"I got your back, soldier.",2
I can't.,0
I don't want to shoot the bunny.,0
"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.",0
"Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.",2
"I can shoot you, fat ass!",0
I can shoot you too!,2
I'll kill you!,0
I'll fill you full of lead!,2
"Hey, what's that?",1
My weenies won't cook.,2
"Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.",2
"Heh, that's not scary.",2
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!,1
"Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!",2
"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.",1
"Yeah, Cartman's pee.",0
"Hey, you would taste my pee!",2
"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.",0
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.,2
"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!",1
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?,2
Whatabutt?,0
"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.",2
"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.",2
Deformed how?,1
"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…",2
A hook.,0
A knife.,1
No! A piece of celery.,2
Celery?,0
"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.",2
"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!",1
"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.",2
"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.",0
"Yeah, give me that flashlight.",1
What is that?,1
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.,0
"Hey, it might be!",2
"Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand.",1
Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!,2
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!,2
"Stan, Stan, wake up!",1
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.,1
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?,0
They're out fishing with Kenny.,1
"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?",0
"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?",1
"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!",0
Look!,1
"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.",2
"Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.",1
Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.,2
Holy crap!,2
What the hell is wrong with you people?!,2
"Hey, wait, aah!",2
"Look, up there.",1
"You guys, it's just me.",2
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg,0
"Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.",2
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!,0
"You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!",2
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.,0
"Hey, seriously you guys!",2
"Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.",1
"Ah, damn it, I can't do it!",0
"Goddammit, don't shoot me!",2
"I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.",2
Whoa!,1
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!",1
Help!,2
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!,2
Oh my God! Look at his leg!,1
Aaaaah!,1
"Whoa, he built a wicker basket",0
"Hey look, Kenny's okay.",1
"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.",0
"Hey, that was easy!",0
What?! Why?!,0
"Yeah, make up your mind, dude!",1
"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.",0
"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.",1
"Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.",0
"Yeah, cartoons kick ass!",2
"Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.",1
"Hiya, Sparky.",0
Who's that?,1
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.,0
Wow! Cool!,1
"Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?",0
"Eh. You're making me sick, dude.",2
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.,0
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.,2
He's not meaner than Sparky.,0
"Oh yeah, let's see. Hey, Sylvester.",2
Sparky'll kick his ass.,0
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.,2
"You're on, dude.",1
"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!",0
"Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.",2
"Sparky, bad dog!",0
"Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.",2
What do you mean?,0
That dog is a gay homosexual.,2
He's just confused.,0
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.,1
"Sick, shut up dude.",0
Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.,2
Who's Middle Park?,1
What's homecoming?,2
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.,0
"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?",1
"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.",0
"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!",0
There he goes again.,2
Get down Sparky! Down!,0
Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.,2
"...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.",2
"Ah, dammit!",2
"Um, I'm not really prepared either.",0
"Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-",0
Eeyy!,2
"Wow, cool!",0
"Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an ""A-""?",2
That's not fair!,2
Stupid puppet.,2
"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?",0
What's a - homosexual?,0
I guess.,0
"You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.",2
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.,1
"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.",2
"Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?",0
"Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.",2
"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay.",0
He still looks pretty gay to me.,2
"Come on you guys, I have an idea.",0
"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.",0
Oolala,1
There he goes.,2
"Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?",0
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.,1
"No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.",2
"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.",0
"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.",1
Like who?,0
"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.",0
Damn it!,0
What'd he say?,1
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.,0
"Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!",2
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?,0
"Come on dude, we have to get to practice.",1
"No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!",0
"Uh, Chef?",1
Chef.,1
Chef!,1
"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.",0
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.,0
Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!,2
"Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.",0
"Wow, it's been like two days.",1
I think he might've run away.,0
Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!,2
We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.,1
I'm not playing.,0
You what?!,1
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog.,0
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?,0
Sparky! Sparky!,0
But I never practiced quarterback.,1
"Fine, how are you?",0
"My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.",0
D'you have lots of gay dogs here?,0
"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.",0
"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!",1
We'll just see about that.,2
"Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!",1
Cartman farted!,1
No I didn't. That was just my shoes.,2
No way dude!,1
"Ah, dude, weak.",1
"That's right, you get back there.",2
Hut.,1
"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?",0
"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.",0
"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?",0
What don't I understand?,0
"Hut, hut.",1
"Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!",1
"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand.",0
Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!,0
"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!",0
"I will Big Gay Al, I will.",0
Hike!,1
I've been getting my best friend back.,0
Hike!,0
"Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think.",1
Mph.,0
Oof.,1
"Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.",0
And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!,0
And it's okay to be gay!,0
"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.",0
"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.",0
"But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.",0
"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.",2
"Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?",0
Wow!,0
"Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?",2
"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.",0
"Your sister beat you up again, huh?",2
"Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.",2
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.,0
"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.",1
"I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!""",2
"My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!",0
"Be a man Stan.  Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies.""",2
"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?",0
You mean this one?,1
He's my new pet elephant.,1
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?,0
"I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.",1
"Wow, that's cool!",0
"No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.",1
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.,2
"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.",0
"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.",1
"Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya.",1
"If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-""",2
Yes ma'am.,2
Mr. Garrison?,1
"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?",1
"That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.",1
That'd be cool!,0
"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.",1
I'll bet you can't.,1
Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!,1
"Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.",0
We can use Cartman's pig.,1
"Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!",2
"We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.",1
"You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no!",2
Yes…,0
"Oh, neither.  It's my sister.",0
Hi Shelly.,0
Headgear?  What headgear?,0
"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.",0
"No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH!",0
Ready to go Stan?,1
Go where?,0
To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.,1
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.,1
Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!,2
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?,1
"Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!""",2
This must be it.,1
"Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.",2
"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.",1
"It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.",2
It's just a stupid pig.,1
"Yeah, quit being such a baby.",0
"Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!",2
At least I'm not a little pigfucker!,0
Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.,2
"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!",1
Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!,2
"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!",1
I'll kick you in the nuts!,2
Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.,1
"No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.",1
"Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.",2
How does that make the world better?,1
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?,0
"Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.",2
"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?",1
Which song is that?,1
You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!,2
"Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?",1
Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy.,1
Come on Fluffy!,2
UUuuhh.  I sure am hungry.,2
"Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!",2
"Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!",1
"God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.",2
"Yeah! Go away, Pip!",0
"Gah, French people piss me off.",2
No! We're already halfway done.,1
It's more than you've got!,1
Oh my God! They cloned a foot.,1
Ugh!…Hey! I'll kick your ass!,2
Hey Chef.,1
"We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.",1
I told you guys.,1
You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!,1
Whaaat?!,2
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.,0
I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.,2
So how do we do that?,0
"Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?",0
"We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.",1
Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?,2
"Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.",1
"Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!""",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!",0
"I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.",2
"Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you.""",1
"Sick dude, she's my sister.",0
"Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.",1
"No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!",2
Come on Kenny.,1
"Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.",2
Crap.,0
"No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.",0
"Come on elephant, keep drinking.",1
"Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig.",0
Dammit! This is never gonna work.,1
"Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.",1
Hey look!  It's working.,1
Aah!,1
Sick!,0
Fluffy!,2
Aren't they ever gonna wake up?,1
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.,1
"Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?",0
"Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?",1
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.,1
"Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!",2
"Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.",0
A big mutant version of me?,0
Is he bigger than a regular clone?,1
How big do you think he is?,1
I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.,0
"Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?",1
Oh my God!,0
"Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.",0
"Come on, let's go!",1
"It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.",0
"Wait, Stan, there he goes.",1
Stop!,0
He recognizes you dude.,1
"That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.",0
What should we do with him?,1
"Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?",0
"…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.",0
"No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman.",0
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!",1
"Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.",0
I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.,2
You can't just leave me here alone.,0
"Oh yeah, watch me.",2
"Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya.",1
Thanks a lot.,0
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!,0
"Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh.",0
"Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.",1
"Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!",0
"Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?",1
"Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.",2
That'll do pig.,2
"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.",0
"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?",0
"Aw, dammit!",0
Heheheh hehehe...,0
"My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan.",0
Sure.,0
I'm not gonna kill you grampa.,0
"'Cause, I'll get in trouble.",0
Leave me alone grampa.,0
"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.",1
But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.,1
"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!",2
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!,2
I'm not going to kill you grampa!,0
Good night grampa.,0
Ow! What the hell was that for?!,1
That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!,2
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.,1
"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!",2
"Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?",2
"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!",0
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?,0
"My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.",0
"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.",1
Really??,0
"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.",1
"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!",2
"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?",0
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.,2
"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.",0
But won't your grampa be there?,1
"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.",2
Hey Chef.,0
Bad.,0
"Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?",0
"No, I mean, kill my grampa.",0
"See, I told you dude.",0
"Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?",1
"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?",2
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.,0
"Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.",0
"No grampa, I'll get in trouble.",0
"No, I can't even kill a deer.",0
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.,2
What!,2
Grampa!,0
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!,2
"Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.",0
Don't talk about my mom like that!,2
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.,0
"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!",2
"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.",0
"Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.",2
"I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.",0
"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.",1
"Hey, yeah!",0
Jesus?,0
"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?",0
Goddammit!,0
What the hell is wrong with everybody?,0
"Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!",2
"Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?",1
"Kyle, don't be such a butthole!",0
"Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.",2
"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!",1
"Oh, biiitch.  Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.",2
"Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.",2
"Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.",0
"Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.",2
"Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.",2
"Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.",2
"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.",0
Aaah!!,0
"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...",0
"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.",0
"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.",1
"Aww, do I have to?",0
"Hey, what are you doing?!",0
What are they doing in there?,1
"Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.",0
"Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time.",0
"Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.",0
"Sure I will grampa, I will.",0
"Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?",0
"Yep, all done.",1
"'Kay, come on guys.",0
Why don't we just shoot him?,2
"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.",0
"Yeah, stupid!",1
Are you ready grampa?,0
"Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.",0
What is that?!,0
"Well, it, it looks like...",1
"Hey, he's coming towards us.",0
Why is Death coming after us?,1
"Aaaah, runrunruuun!",2
What are we gonna do?,1
"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!",0
"Yeah, but, mom!",0
"Dad, Death is coming!",0
"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.",0
"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.",1
Totally dude.,0
Good point man.,1
"Quick, jump through the window.",0
"Ehh, eh, ehhhh!",2
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!,1
Hey look!,0
"Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.",2
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!",1
"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.",0
"Come on you guys, let's go home.",0
"You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!",2
"Ohhh, God, No!",2
"Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?",1
"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.",0
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.,2
"Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?",1
Cool!,0
Yeah!,2
What are you doing grampa?,0
That's my silly grampa.,0
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!,0
You bastards!,1
What the hell is that thing?,2
It looks like a UFO.,1
There's no such thing as UFOs.,2
"Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.",2
"Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.",1
"Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.",0
"Ha ha, you look like a pansy.",1
Shut up Kyle!,0
"What uh, what are you supposed to be?",1
I'm Raggedy Andy.,0
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?,1
"Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.",0
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.,1
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.,0
"Hey, dudes.",2
Cartman! What kind of costume is that?,1
"It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.",2
Where'd you get that?,0
"My mom made it, isn't it cool?",2
No it's not cool!,1
"What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?",2
"No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!",0
"Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.",2
Hehe. Sissy.,1
"I'll kick your ass, Kyle!",0
"Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!",2
"Hey look, Kenny's not dead.",0
You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.,1
"Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?",0
"Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?",1
"Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!  Poor piece of crap.",2
"Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.",0
"I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank.""",0
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...,1
Everyone came as Chewbacca?!,1
Dammit!,1
Wendy?,0
"You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?",0
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.,0
You what?!,0
"There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?",2
"Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!",1
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!,2
Wookies don't live on Endor!,1
Wookies don't live on Endor.,2
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!,1
What?! What did you say?!,2
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!,1
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.,1
"Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.",2
Aren't you hungry Kenny?,1
"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.",0
Eating Kenny's pudding.,2
"Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.",2
"My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!",2
"Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o.",2
"Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.",1
"Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!",2
Could I see that again? That was cool.,2
"I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.",2
I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!,2
Boo! I'm a ghost.,2
"Oh man, I feel like a total choad.",0
"Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.",2
Hey Chef.,2
"Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?",2
"Hey, where's Kyle?",0
Check this out!,1
What is that?,2
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!,1
"Dude, I thought she was dead.",1
"Yeah, me too.",0
"What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!",1
"Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!",0
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.,0
"Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.",2
I bet I get more candy than you dude.,0
Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.,2
"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.",0
"Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.",2
"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!",0
"God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!",2
Hey dudes.,1
"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...",0
Check.,2
Plastic pumpkin pails...,0
Check.,1
Taser...,0
"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.",0
"Yeah, granola pisses me off.",2
"Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.",2
You still didn't get a costume Kenny?,1
"Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.  I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!  I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.",2
Hi Wendy.,2
How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!,0
You what?! Are you insane?!,2
"I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.",0
How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?,2
"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!",0
"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!",0
"Dude, Kenny!",0
"Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.",2
"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.",0
"You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!",2
Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!,2
"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!",0
Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!,2
Can we have some candy now please?!,2
I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!,2
What are you talking about Chef?,0
"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.",1
"Oh my God, that means...",0
If everyone is turned into zombies...,1
"Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!",2
"Chef, you've gotta help us!",1
"Wait, where are we going?",0
It was Kyle.,2
I don't know about this Chef.,0
"Yeah, I'm scared.",1
"Remember candy, focus on the candy.",2
What are we doing here Chef?,0
I found it! I found it!,1
"See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.",1
"Eh, shit...",2
We told you dude.,0
"You guys, shit...",2
Hey Chef. Look.,0
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!,2
"Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?",0
Chef!!!,1
Let's get out of here!,0
We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.,0
"Hey, there's a pay phone!",2
You call the number Kyle.,0
But the zombies are coming!,1
We'll hold 'em off.,0
"Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!  Aaah, kew!",2
There's a bunch of zombies here!,1
"Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!",2
"I know, but uh-... but...",0
Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?,2
"Hey, yeah!",0
"Uh, okay. Then what?",1
"Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.",0
Kill her Stan!,2
"Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!",1
"Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.",1
"I, I can't.",0
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!,1
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.,0
It's working! They're turning back to normal.,1
"Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!",2
"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.",0
"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.",0
"Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.",1
"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.",0
"Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way.",2
"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.",0
"...No, dude, that's Christmas.",1
"Oh, then, what's Halloween about?",0
Costumes and candy.,1
Oh.,0
"Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.",2
"We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.",1
"Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.",2
"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.",0
"Lehh, eh, screw you guys!",2
That was awesome!,0
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.,2
"And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!",2
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.,2
"Oh, cool.",1
"Hey, who's that fat chick?",0
"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.",1
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.,0
"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.",1
"Yeah, HEY!",2
"That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?",2
KICK ASS!!,2
SWEET!,0
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.,0
Did they say if it's waterproof?,1
Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.,0
What did she say?,1
"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.",0
Ass-raper.,1
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.,0
When do we get the sports watch?,2
Just a second fat-ass!,0
You vas-deferens!,2
"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?",0
Ask her if we get the watch right away.,1
Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.,0
"I get to wear it first, you guys.",2
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.,1
"Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.",2
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?,2
"You mean, like Kenny?",0
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?,2
"I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!",2
"Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!",2
"Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!",2
"Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!",2
"I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?",2
Damn.,0
"Hey, look you guys.",1
The digital sports watch is here.,1
What the hell?,2
"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.",0
"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.",1
"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.",0
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.,1
"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?",0
What's your name dude?,1
I think he said his name is Marvin.,0
"Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.",2
Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.,1
Hey mooom?,2
"We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?",2
Sweet.,2
"Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.",0
"Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.",1
No no! He's my son! I adopted him.,2
It was my mom's credit card.,0
"Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.",1
"Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.",2
Totally.,1
Ahh!,2
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.',0
"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.",2
"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.",2
"No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.",2
"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.",0
"Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...",2
"Yeah, yeah, we do!",0
"Yeah, that's right.",2
We do!,1
"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin.",1
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.,0
"No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!",2
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.,0
"Yeah, that one.",1
"Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.",1
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.,1
So why can't he live here now?,0
Because why?,1
Then you take care of him.,1
"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.",0
"Oh well, back to the poor country with you.",2
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.,1
"B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.",2
"Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!",2
"Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!",2
Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!,1
"Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!",2
I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!,2
"Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!",2
"Hey, where's Cartman?",0
"I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?",1
"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!",0
"Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!  I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.",2
But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!,2
WEEEEEEAK!!!,2
Here you go turkeys!,1
"Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...  I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.  Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.  Huh, I wonder what's in here?  SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!  Sally Struthers?!",2
Gimme that cake!,2
"No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!",2
"No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!  You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!",2
"Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!",0
We did it!!,0
"Wow, it sucks he has to leave.",0
"Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.",1
"You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.",0
Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.,1
"That's right you will, God-Damnit.  Move it POVs, I'm an American!",2
"Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus",0
"Come on, Mary!  Push!",1
I can see its head!,1
It's a boy!,1
Oohhhh!,2
...Sorry,1
Oh dude!  Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!,2
"Shut up, fat boy!",1
"I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.",2
"Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?",0
I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...,1
"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-",1
Christmas Poo?,0
What the hell is Christmas Poo?,2
"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?",1
"Whoa, Christmas snow!",0
"That was sick, dude!",0
Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!,2
"We can, too!",1
"...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.",0
Officer Barbrady!,1
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?,1
Damnit!,1
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.,0
"Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.",2
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.,1
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.,2
"We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.",0
"Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.",1
"Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?",0
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.,1
"Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.",2
"Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!",1
"You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle.",2
"See you around, dude.",0
"It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas",1
"What's going on, you guys?",1
The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.,0
"Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!",2
"Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?",1
"It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-",1
Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.,2
Wait...,1
"But dad, he always sh...",1
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.,1
Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.,1
I said Ike's on fire!,1
It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!,1
I'm not hearing that.,1
Mr. Hankey?,1
"Go away, Mr. Hankey.",1
I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.,1
Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.,1
"Mr. Hankey, come here.",1
"Say something, Mr. Hankey!",1
Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?,1
"Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.",1
"Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.",1
Yeah!  We'll show them!,1
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!,0
How do you know?,2
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.,0
"Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.",2
"I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.",2
"Hello, everybodyyy.",1
"What's in the box, dude?",0
It's a surprise.,1
Let me see!,2
O-Okay.  But don't scare him...,1
"Dude, sick!!!",0
Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?,2
Wait! You guys!  He's alive!,1
"Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.",0
"Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!",1
Thanks to Kyle's mother.,2
"How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor.",2
"I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!",1
"O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.",2
Mr. Hankey.,1
"Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!",2
"Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair, 
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BI-I-I-ITCH - aahh.",2
"Mr. Hankey, no!",1
"Gross, Kyle!",2
Uuuuuuhh...,1
YOU SICK BASTARD!,2
I don't have a problem.,1
Mookie-stinks?,1
"Wull, not on purpose.",1
"Well, sometimes...",1
Well sure.,1
"No, dude!",1
But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...,1
Here.  Just look more closely at it.,1
"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.",0
I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.,1
"Bye, Kyle!  Happy Channukah!",2
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...",1
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.,0
"Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.",2
"This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.",0
We committed him.,0
'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.,2
Huh?!  O-oh.,0
"This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!",0
I believe.,0
"Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!",2
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.",0
"I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...",1
"Oh no, I'm not sane yet!",1
Friends?,1
You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy?,1
Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!,2
"You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.",0
"Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right.",1
"Yeah, something feels...unfinished",2
Wh-what could it be?,0
"Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...",2
"What is this, Cartman?",1
They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.,2
"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?",0
"Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...",2
"Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.",1
"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.",0
That's ri-aayy.,2
"Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...",2
"No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.",2
Eeeeeeh!,2
"Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?",2
"Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof!",2
"Whoa, dude!",0
"Damn, what a freak!",1
Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!,2
"Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.",2
"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?",0
Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.,1
Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.,2
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.,0
"Yeah, that's weak!",1
"Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?",2
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.,0
"Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.",2
"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is.",0
"Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is.",2
"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?",0
"Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!",2
"You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!",1
"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!",2
"Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.",0
What the...&#160;?,0
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.,1
"Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!",2
"Hey, Chef.",0
"Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.",1
The new kid.,1
"We told you, dude.",1
"Jesus, Jesus!",0
"Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.",0
"Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.",1
"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.",0
Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.,0
... K.,1
"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money...",2
"Ohh, dude!",1
You're gonna fight Satan?,0
"Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!",2
"I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?",0
Cartman's birthday!,2
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!,1
"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.",2
"Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.",0
"Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!",2
Did the Devil show up yet?,0
"Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?",1
"Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.",2
"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.",0
"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'",0
"Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!",2
"Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!",2
"Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.",0
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.,1
"Bubye, Fartboy.",0
See ya.,1
"Hey, Jesus.",0
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.,1
"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.",0
"Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?",1
"You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?",2
"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.",0
"But you're his sparring partner, Chef.",0
"Yeah, you have to hit him.",1
"Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.",2
"Hey, you just got here, Chef!",1
"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.",0
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?,2
"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.",0
"And neither were you, Pip!",1
Wow!,1
"Whoa, that was cool!",0
"Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.",1
Yeah. Come on in and join the party.,2
"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?",2
"It's a game, dude. It's really fun.",1
YOU SON OF A BITCH!,2
Aaaaa!,1
"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP!",2
They were all out of 'em dude!,1
I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!,2
Aaaaaaaa!,1
"That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!",2
"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!",0
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!,2
"Aaanh, he does this all the time.",0
"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.",0
"Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.",1
"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!",0
Uuuuh. Stan?,1
Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!,0
Stan.,1
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!,0
Stan!,1
"Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.",1
... Really?,0
"Yeah, dude!",1
"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'",0
"You did, Jesus.",0
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?,1
"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.",0
Hmmm.,1
Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.,0
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny.",0
You bastard!,1
You're leaving already?,0
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.,0
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.,1
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?,0
Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.,2
"I can't afford a cruise, dude.",0
"Shut up, Cartman!",0
"That is so-ho lame!  Oh man, I...",2
"Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.",2
We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.,1
"Wow, she's pretty.",2
You can say that again.,0
"Yes, ma'am.",2
Yeu-bluuuch.,0
"Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.",2
"I'll kick your ass, Cartman!",0
Bluuuch,0
"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!",1
"She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!",2
"Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!",1
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!,0
Until you puked on her.,2
"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!",1
"Yeah, that one!",0
"Sure, Wendy, whatever.",0
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents.,1
Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!,0
I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners,2
"Memememememe, me!",2
Bluuch! I'd love to.,0
What's a multiplication table?,2
We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-,2
My laundry detergent?,1
That's not Kyle's...,0
Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.,2
"We've got to learn how to do that, dude!",0
Yup!,1
"Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!",2
"Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.",2
"Stop kissing ass, Cartman!",1
"I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!",2
"Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.",0
Bluuch.,0
See? She liked my present the best!,0
"Where's your present, Cartman?",1
"Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home",2
"Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.",2
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!,1
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!,0
I bet I scored 100!,0
"Oh, hi, Wendy.",0
"No, she wasn't!",1
That's impossible!,0
Nuh-uh!,2
Oh cool.,1
"Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!",2
"Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.",1
"Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass.",2
"Oh, hi, Chef.",2
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?,1
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?,0
A whatbian?,0
A plebeian?,1
"Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef.",0
"Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?",1
"Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!",0
"Hey, yeah!",1
"You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.",2
"You're just saying that, Cartman.",0
"Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.",1
"I am, too!",2
"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?",0
My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.,2
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.,0
And I got these killer Birken-stocks.,1
This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!,2
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.,0
I'm a bigger lesbian than you!,2
"No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.",0
"Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!",1
"Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John.",2
"Wow. Hi, Wendy.",0
Dang! That's nice!,2
"Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.",0
"Oh, weak, dude!",2
Bluuch. Kick ass!,0
Are we making love now?,0
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.,0
"You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.",0
But why?,0
"It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?",0
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?,1
Did you make love?,2
I think so.,0
No way!,2
Down by the fire?,1
Did I what?,0
That's not what we just heard!,2
What the hell...?,2
"Oh my God, she killed Kenny!",0
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.,0
"Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.",0
Bluuuuch!,0
"Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!",1
"Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.",2
"I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.",1
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-,1
Wendy! You didn't!,1
Boooriing.,2
Isn't that your job?,0
Oooh.,0
"Day is never finished, Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...",2
"Dude. Shut up, Cartman.",0
"No, I found it.",2
"No, I did, Pip.",2
"Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.",2
"Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.",2
"Okay, ready? I'll go first.",2
"Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle!",2
"Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.",1
What is it?,0
I don't know.,1
Eeyy! Give me that back!,2
"You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.",1
We'll roshambo for it!,2
"No way, fatty, it's mine!",1
ANTHROPOLOGIST!,2
"I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!",2
"You threw it away, fatso!",1
"Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it!",2
"Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'",1
"...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!",2
"You liar, Cartman!",1
"Screw you, triangle thief!",2
"What are you going to do with it, dude?",0
"I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.",1
"Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.",2
"You did throw it away, Cartman.",0
I was just setting it aside.,2
"Well, you might as well let it go.",0
Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!,2
I have a button we can use for his nose.,0
What would we use a marble sack for?,1
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.,2
I didn't steal anything.,1
"Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?",2
Good!,1
What's that noise?,2
Aaah! Aliens!,2
Aagh! Stop that!,1
"Ow, that sucks, dude!",0
...so?,0
Like John Elway important?,0
D'you know John Elway?,0
"Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!",0
Yyeeaahh.,1
"No! I found it, he stole it!",2
"You threw it away, Cartman!",1
"I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.",2
Yeah. How'd you know?,1
Triangle of Zinthar?,1
"Why do you wanta know, lady?!",0
AAAAAA!,1
Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!,2
It's Saturday.,0
"You scared the crap out of me, Ike!",2
"I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?",2
"Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!",1
"Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!",2
"Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!",1
Huh?!,2
"If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!",1
"Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.I got the triangle, I got the triangle, dee dun dee dun",2
"Man, the bus sure is late.",0
"Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.",2
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.,1
Fine.,0
Your triangle?,1
Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!,2
"Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...",2
It is?,2
"Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.",0
"Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45.",1
"Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on.",0
"Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-",2
"Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!",2
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?,1
"No, not when money is involved, stupid!",2
Ugh. Llet me go! Seriously!,2
"Yeah, let us go!",0
"Eey!  It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!",2
"Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!",1
"Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.",2
I don't remember.,2
Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!,1
No! Don't!  AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!,2
"WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!",2
"Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.",0
"Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe.",2
"Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?",1
I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!,2
Yes! She stole my triangle!,2
Get us down from here!,0
"Whoa, that was cool!",1
Robert Smith? Sweet!,0
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!",0
Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her!,2
"My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?",0
Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!,0
"Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.",0
The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.,1
"Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!",0
He did it!,0
"No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!",1
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!,0
No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!,2
Huh?  Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!,2
"Good-bye, Robert Smith!",0
Thanks for your help! Visit us again!,2
Disintegration is the best album everrr!,1
"Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?",0
We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted!,1
"Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.",0
"No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!",2
"Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?!",1
"Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll roshambo you for it!",2
"Go to hell, Cartman!",0
"Well, that whole experience sure did suck.",1
Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.,0
"But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.",1
"Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!  Oh no! She's back!",2
Oh my God! Look!,0
"Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.",0
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong,1
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.,0
"We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!",0
"I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.",0
"Whoa, dude.",1
I always wondered if that would work.,0
"Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.",1
In the backyard?,0
"Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?",2
"You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.  Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?",2
"Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.",2
"Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you.",2
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!,1
"No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.",0
"Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.",2
"Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.",1
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.,0
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.,1
Woo-whataya mean?,1
Is that legal?,0
"My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.",2
"That's niiice, Peter Panda.",2
"Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.",0
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?,1
"I donnow, just keep rolling.",0
"More tea, Rumpertumskin?",2
"Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?",2
Eeeyy!,2
"No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!",2
"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!",2
Mom? Can I ask you a question?,2
"You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?",2
"And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?",2
God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!,2
I want to know where I came from.,2
Uh huuh.,2
So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?,2
"So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?",2
"That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.",2
Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Naive American.,2
"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!",2
"Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!",0
"Yeah, dude. It looks riveting.",1
Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.,0
Aaawww.,0
Hunh?,1
This guy sucks!,0
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.,1
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?,0
"Naive American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people.",2
"Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!  Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.",2
"What are you talking about, Cartman?!",0
"My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?",2
"Go ahead, dude.",0
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.,1
"Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!",0
"Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video.",1
"Hiya, Dad!",2
"I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.",2
Liane Cartman.,2
But my mom says you're the guy she was with.,2
Whatooya mean?,2
Huh??,2
Eeyy!!,2

Oh my God! I'm a black African American!,2
"Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.",0
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?,1
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.,0
"If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.",1
Shhh! Here comes Cartman.,0
"'S up, homies?",2
Cartman?!,0
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.,2
"You live on the Eastside, Cartman!",1
"Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.",0
Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.  You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.,2

"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.",0
"Yo, Pops!",2
"You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?",2
Westsa-eed-eh.,2
"You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.",2
He said you kissed her with your tongue.,2
Huho. So you're not my dad?,2
What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!,2
"No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!",2
"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.",2
Really? You don't think so?,2
"Gee, that's kewl.",2
Huh?  Oh yeah.,0

"Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!",0
"We're gonna win $10,000!",1
Man! Cartman's gonna be famous!,0
"All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!",2
It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!,2
Then you did sleep with my mom?,2
Really? You can?,2
I don't have $3000.,2
"Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.",0
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.,1
Hi guys.,2
"How's it going, Cartman?",0
"Oh, fine. How are you guys?",2
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?,1
Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.,2
"Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?",0
"Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.",2
"Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.",0
"Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...  Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.",2
"Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.",1
"Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.",0
"You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!",2
"Uh, yyeah.",0
What kind of video did you guys make?,2
"Uuh, you'll see.",0
"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.",2
"We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!",0
I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.,2
They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!,1
"Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!",0
Dude. We lost.,0
"I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously.",2
Grampa!!,0
"Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.",1
Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!,2
"Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!",0
"Dad, how could you?!",1
What?!  Son of a bitch!,2
He's my father?!,2
"Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.",2
"Oooh- hey, Kenny.",0
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!,2
Goddammit! Who's my father?,2
You've got to be kidding me!,2
Eeeehh..!,2
Is he awake yet?,2
He's bleeding pretty bad back here.,1
What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?,1
Could you pull over so I can get out?,0
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.,0
"Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.",1
They can't. Mephesto can't die.,2
"Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.",1
"No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, ""Come Sail Away"", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.",2
"Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.",2
I'm sailing away,1
No! Don't!,2
Set an open course for the virgin sea...,1
"Eh-- 
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads",2
"Whoa, dude!",1
"Ugh. I can't do it, dude.",0
"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.",1
"Yeah, stop being a wuss!",2
"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!",1
Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.,0
Oogh.,0
Ooooogh.,0
Aghh!,0
I'm gotta get outta here!,0
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.,2
"Wake up, you son of a bitch!",2
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?,2
"Hey, Cartman.",1
I'm sailing ay...,1
"--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...",2
"Okay okay, let's get outta here now!",0
I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.,1
"Oh, weak.",0
"...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--",2
"Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee",2
"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?",0
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?,2
Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?,2
"No way, dude!",0
Oh boy.  Bleech!,0
Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!,1
Sweet.,2
"Hey, who's screwing with the lights?",2
That is really starting to piss me off.,2
"Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.",2
"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?",2
D'you have any wire here?,1
"No, he'll die!",1
"Go, Kenny!",2
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!",0
"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.",0
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.,1
Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.,2
"Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?",0
I don't know. Let's find out.,1
Just tell us already!,2
Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!,2
"Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.",2
"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!",0
"Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!",2
"No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!",2
"Ooohhh, forget it!",2
Reading sucks ass.,2
Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.,1
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.,0
"Wow, these books look cool!",1
"Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.",2
"God, shut up, dude.",2
"If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?",0
"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical.",1
"I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.",2
I don't know. Let's go see.,0
"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?",0
"Hey, what's this?",0
It looks like a note.,1
Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.,1
"Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.",0
"Whoa, dude, what's going on?",1
"I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.",0
"I can't see, dude!",0
How about a brain transplant?,1
"No, we just fake it to shut him up.",0
"Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?",2
Oooaaagh.,2
"I'm prepared!  For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?",2
"Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.",2
God-dammit!,2
Goody two-shoes.,2
"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.",0
"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?",1
"Oh, my God! They've killed--",0
"Oh, never mind.",0
Oh no!,1
"It's cool, dude. We'll help you.",0
Really? I wanna be a cop.,2
Do I get a nightstick?,2
"10-4, sergeant!",2
"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft"".",0
I.,0
"Here, give me that.  ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond.""",1
"A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.",0
Ey!,2
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?,2
"Step out of the car, please, sir.",2
"Sir, step out of the car, please.",2
"Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!",2
Get your ass to jail!,2
"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.",0
"Here! Here, I found one!",1
What's it say? What's it say?,0
"It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?",1
I dunno.,0
"Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them.",2
"Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?",2
"Sir, step out of the car.",2
Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.,2
Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.,2
"How's it goin', dude?",1
"Come on, dude, it's not that hard!",0
Just read the sentence.,1
"Come on, dumbass, you can do it!",1
"Sir, could you step out of the car, please?",2
"And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?",2
Poor people tend to live in clusters.,2
"Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...",2
"Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.",2
"Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!",2
Chickenlover!,2
Maybe we were wrong about the clue.,0
"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.",1
Look!,0
He's here!,1
Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!,2
"Oh my God, they've killed--",0
"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.",0
"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!",1
"What are you talking about, dude?!",0
So you fucked a bunch of chickens?,1
"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.",0
Freeze! Put your hands in the air!,2
I got reports that the suspect is in this area!,2
"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.",1
A-ha!,2
Cartman!,0
"Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!",2
Ooohhhh.,2
"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?",1
Hey! So what are you going to do now?,0
"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.",0
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!,1
"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.",2
"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.",0
It's poetic justice.,1
Booooo!,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?",0
"We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?",1
Okay?,2
Why do dogs have cold noses?,0
"Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?",1
"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?",0
"No, it's his bris.",1
"What the hell is a ""bris""?",2
"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.",1
"Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!",2
"Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?",0
Uhhh... I'm not sure.,1
"Well, dude, you better find out!",0
"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?",0
"Man! That sucked, getting searched.",0
"Yeah, my ass is killing me.",2
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.,1
I wonder who took it.,2
How's it going?,1
Why bad?,1
"No, dude, we never even saw it!",0
"We know, we know, that's what everybody says.",0
"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.",1
"I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.",2
"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?",1
What do ya mean?,0
Wo-what's that?,2
"Ahhh, bicycles?",0
Ham?,2
"No, not ham, you fat fuck!",1
"Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?",2
Your heart?,1
Your eyes?,0
"Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.",2
"That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.",2
"Hey, wait!",1
"Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.",0
Kyle! You have to stop them!,0
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!,0
They're gonna chop off his wee wee!,0
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!,1
"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!",0
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!,2
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!,1
"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.",0
"Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!",2
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!,1
Mom! Dad!,1
What the hell is gahekgafuga?,2
"Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?",1
Meaning what?,1
They are gonna cut off his fireman!,2
AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!,1
I can't believe my parents are cannibals!,1
"What are you goin' to do, dude?",0
"I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.",1
"No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!",2
"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!",1
"Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?",1
"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?",1
I need one ticket for my little brother.,1
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!,1
"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.",1
"Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!",1
"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!",1
"There, what do you think?",1
What the hell is that supposed to be?,2
"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.",1
"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.",0
"Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!",1
"Dude, what did you make that doll out of?",0
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.,1
Is that why it stinks so bad?,2
"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!",1
No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!,2
"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you.",0
"Eech.  Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!",2
"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky.",1
"Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up.",1
"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him.",1
"Put him down, you stupid dog!",1
"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?",1
"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!",1
"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!",1
"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!",0
Fireman!,2
"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.",1
You bastards!,1
"Aw, how the hell should I know?",1
"All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother.",1
"Yeah, right.",1
He's not my brother!,1
"I'm sorry, Ike.",1
"Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.",2
"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!",1
"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.",0
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.,1
"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!",1
You stay away from my little brother!,1
"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!",1
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!,1
"Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye.",2
"No!  No, it isn't true!",1
"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!",0
"Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too.",2
"It's okay, Ike. I'm here.",1
"Ike, you're okay.",1
"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.",0
"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.",1
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.,1
Naturally.,0
"Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!",2
"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?",2
"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.",0
"No way, I set up mine first, hippie!",2
"Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?",0
M'kay?,1
We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.,1
What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?,2
"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.",0
"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.",0
"No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.",1
"Dammit, we lost one already!",0
"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup!",0
We're losing men fast out here!,0
I caught it! I caught it!,1
"Here, Pip, you throw.",1
"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?",1
"Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow!",1
"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!",1
"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.",2
"No. No, it'll be okay!",1
Oh-- Noooo!,1
Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.,2
"Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?",2
"No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.",0
Ye-yes.,1
Oh!  Phew.,1
"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.",1
AAGGGGGHHHH!!,1
OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!,1
AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!,1
"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.",1
"Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?",2
No. No-it looked dead.,1
Wa-was it wearing clothes?,0
"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?",1
"Oh, yeah. Eeww.",0
And then she walked over to--,1
"Who the hell cares what it's called, as long as she doesn't have to touch me.",2
AGGGGGGHHHHHH!,0
AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!,2
Uhhhh... Yeah.,1
No! I have to get it out!,0
ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!,0
"Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?",0
Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.,2
"Aw, do we have to?",0
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?,1
Heyh! They have a zoo there!,2
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?,0
"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?",1
"Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.",2
"Whoa, dude, this is a school?",0
"I caught it, I caught it!",2
"Go for it, Pip.",1
"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!",1
"Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap.",2
"Get him, Frenchy!",1
"Okay, what have you got?",0
"Some hadka fish, some gafagga...",1
I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!,2
Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places!,0
"Chef, we're hungry.",0
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.,2
"Wow, that was easy.",1
"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?",1
Know what?,1
"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!",0
But we could get killed!,1
"Dude, Chef has lost it.",0
"So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?",2
"Dude, what does that mean?",1
I dunno.,2
"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?",0
"Yeah, you're from China.",1
Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!,0
"Come on, rice picker!",2
You don't?,0
"But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.",1
"Oooh, I get it.",2
"Damn, dude. China's fucked up.",0
You... bastards...,1
"Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?",0
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?,1
Agghh!,1
"Dude, it's the freak nurse!",0
Holy crap!,2
"Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.",1
"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.",1
"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.",0
"I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)",2
"Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?",2
"Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?",1
"Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.",0
"Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.",1
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.,0
Was it fun?,2
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!,1
"Man, Vietnam was sweet!",2
"""...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end.",0
"Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?",1
From Vietnam veterans.,0
"No, no, we didn't--",0
F-minus? Can he do that?,1
"Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--",0
How do you know? You weren't even there.,1
"You're dead, Stan.",2
"For what, dude?",0
"Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.",2
"Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!",1
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?,0
"Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!",2
"We've got to get him back, dude.",1
Totally.,2
"Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.",1
"Well, what do you mean?",0
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy...,1
"Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!",2
"Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!",1
"Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.",0
Come on! We've gotta make another one!,1
Lying kicks ass!,2
"Ready, you guys?",0
Okay. Action!,0
Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!,2
Cut! Cartman!,0
It's supposed to be a frog!,0
I know that!,2
"Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?",0
It's a Sri Lanka frog!,2
"Der, Cartman!",1
"Der yourself, hippie!",2
"Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk!",1
"Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?",0
"I'm ready, Steven Spielberg!",2
Action!,0
Blulululuh. Screw you guys.,2
"Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?",2
"'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!",1
Ee-goddammit!,2
"Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.",0
They better not!,2
"Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.",0
Scared of a plastic frog?,2
"It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?",0
"Man, this is stupid.",2
Good. A-and action!,0
Eee-ee-ee-ee!,2
"Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.",1
"Dude, totally.",2
"They deserve it for lying to us, dude.",0
"Revenge is so very, very sweet.",2
They're here! Hurry and hide!,0
"Holy crap, dude.",0
"Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!",0
Look!,1
"Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!",0
We shot all those videos and sent them in.,0
"Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke!",1
"Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!",1
"Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'.",0
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.,0
"Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!",0
Dibs!,2
"Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me.",0
You big piece of crap!,0
"That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie!",2
"Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!",2
"Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!",0
"Ey, you guys!",2
"W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble.",0
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.,0
"Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!",0
"No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.",0
"During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!",0
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!,1
"Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.",2
"W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.",0
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.,1
Wait a sec. Where is your producer?,1
Sent her away where?,2
"Hey, Cartman!",0
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?,0
"Hmmm, let me see. No!",2
"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!",1
Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.,2
"Give us some, Cartman!",0
"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.",1
"Dude, the road is always snowy.",0
"I know, but, it's really snowy today.",1
"Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can.",2
"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.",0
"Oh, she would, dude. She would.",1
"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.",0
"I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.",2
"Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!",1
I'm scared!,1
All done!,2
Where are we?,0
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.,0
"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?",1
Ms. Crabtree?,2
"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!",1
"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'",1
"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.",0
"You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.",2
"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days.",1
I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck!,2
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.,0
Worse than this?,1
"Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.",0
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.,1
"Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!",1
"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!",2
It's completely immature!,2
"Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?",0
You guys can't scare me!,2
"Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass.",0
"Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.",1
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.,0
"Now, that was what I call a sticky situation.",0
You can say that again.,1
Was that how it happened?,2
Do you see 'er dude?,0
Nope.,1
"God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?",2
"Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.",1
"No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!",0
"Don't do it, kid.",1
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.,0
"Holy crap, dude!",1
"Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.",0
What time is it?,0
On Wednesday or Thursday?,1
"Dude, I think it's Saturday now.",0
What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.,2
"Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.",1
"Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.",0
What do you think it is?,2
"I don't know, it's- a big scary monster.",0
"Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt.",1
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.,1
Heellp!,2
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!,1
"Hey, look!",0
Dude! He's making ice cream.,1
Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!,2
"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.",1
"Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.",0
"Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.",2
"Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!",1
"Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?",2
Beefcaake!,2
"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.",2
"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.",0
"Oh, yeah.",2
What was that?,0
"Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!",0
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.,1
"Hey yeah, I remember that.",1
Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!,0
You... bastard?,1
"Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.",0
"Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right?",1
"Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!",0
"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.",0
Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?,2
I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again?,2
We've just gotta stick together.,1
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.,0
"Hay, wait a minute.",2
Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?,2
"You can do it, Fonzie.",2
"We believe in you, Fonz.",0
"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.",2
"You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!",0
"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?",1
"Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense.",2
Oh no!,0
"Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much!",0
There.  I think we got it.,1
"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.",0
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.,1
It does?,2
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?,1
"Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream!",1
"Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.",2
"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.",1
Hey yeah!,0
Du-hude! Your dad's a retard!,1
"Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?",0
Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?,2
"Boy, do I!",0
Sweeeeeett!,2
"This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father! 
My father is John Elway, my father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.",2
"Now, that's what I call a sti-",2
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.,1
"What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts!",2
"Cartman, no!",0
The bus is going over!,0
Hey! We've landed in ice cream!,0
"Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-",2
"Deah, eh eh.  Oh man, what a weird dream!",2
"Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.",2
"Yes, please.",2
Mmmm.  Mmmm.,2
"GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare.",0
"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.",0
"Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.",0
Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.,1
"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.",0
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?,1
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later.,0
"Shut up, Pip.",0
"Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!",2
"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.",0
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.,1
"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.",0
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.,1
"Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!",2
"Jesus, Cartman!",0
"Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.",2
We wanna buy M-80s.,1
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.,0
"Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys! I'm going home.",2
What a baby.,1
"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.",0
Heard what?,0
What do ya mean?,1
"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?",1
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?,0
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.,1
"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!",0
Oo bastards!,1
"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.",0
"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?",1
"Man, it's hot out here.",0
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!,2
"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.",1
I know! Let's go sledding!,0
"Come on, Cartman, get on.",0
Stan?,2
"Let's go, dude. We're ready.",1
"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?",0
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?,2
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!,1
Ugh... Whatever.,2
What the hell is going on?,0
"Hi, Uncle Jimbo.",0
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.,1
"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.",0
Dusty the dirtball,1
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?,0
"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.",1
"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.",0
"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?",1
That's good.,0
Yup.,1
Right.,0
"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?",2
"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.",0
It is not!,2
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.,0
"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.",1
I am not swimming around in pee!,2
"Whatever, dude.",0
"My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.",2
"Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.",1
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.,2
"But Cartman, we're trying to--",0
"Uh, screw you guys. Home.",2
"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?",0
"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.",1
"There, how does that look?",0
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.,1
"Uh, crap..!",0
Eh-eh-eh-eh...,2
Egh--,2
"Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!",2
He's taking swimming lessons.,0
Later's fine.,2
I only know how to do it doggie style.,2
Can I do it doggie style?,2
"Sweet..!  Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!",2
No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.,2
"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?",0
Fine.,2
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.,1
"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!",2
Dude! That thing is huge!,1
"Yeah, they need to shut it off.",0
Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!,2
Kenny! Watch out!,1
"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!",0
"Man, this sucks.",0
"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!",1
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.,0
Where is Chef?,2
"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.",0
Wow.,2
How is that gonna help?,1
Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.  Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.,2
How many days left in summer?,0
"A lot, I think.",1
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!,0
"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon.",1
We're bored.,1
There's nothin' to do.,0
Wow! These are huge!,1
"Hey, look! We blew up the snake!",0
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.  I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!,2
"Huh?  Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!",2
"Hey, look! It's snowing!",1
Winter's back!,0
"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?",1
"Well, I can hardly wait.",0
"Hey, Chef!",0
How's it going?,2
"They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?",1
"Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.",0
"No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.",2
"Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!",2
"I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!",2
...bitch.,2
I'm going!,2
"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.",0
I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!,2
She's not my girlfriend.,0
"Sick, Kenny.",1
"Damn, dude. Look at all these people.",0
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?,1
Whatcha doin'?,0
What kind of cookies?,2
"Calm down, tubby.",0
I wanna Fudge 'Em.,2
"Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?",2
"Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway.",0
"She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.",2
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.,1
"Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.",2
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.,0
They what?!,0
"Oh, brother.",0
"I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-",1
"I'm poopies, ma!",1
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-,1
Could it be?,1
"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?",1
"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!",1
"Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.",2
"Well, I'm sure it was him.",1
"So how was that movie last night, dude?",1
"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!",0
"It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?",2
"Yeah, pretty much.",0
"The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.",0
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.,1
Ay!,2
"Dude, now that'd be like IMAX.",0
"Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.",2
"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home.",2
Well?,1
"I'm gonna, just give me a minute.",2
Are they good?,0
"Hey, dude, these are good!",0
"Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef.",2
There it is again!,1
There is what again?,0
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.,1
"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?",0
Where does that grill go?,1
"To the sewer, dude.",0
"Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!",1
"Aw, man, smells like ass down here.",2
"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!",1
"Aw, man, let's get out of here!",2
"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey.",1
What the hell?,1
Mr. Garrison?,0
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?,2
In a sewer?,1
"This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?",2
"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?",1
"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.",2
I told you guys he'd be here!,1
"Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh.",2
No.,2
"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?",1
Oh my God.,2
And that's why you got a cold?,1
"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?",0
"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys.",1
"Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?",1
Aaahh!,1
"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.",1
"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die.",1
"Dude, no one even listened to me.",1
"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.",0
"Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.",2
All of us?,2
"Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.",2
Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?,1
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.,1
We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.,1
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.,1
"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!",1
"Jeez, they made that into a movie already?",0
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!,2
"I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.",2
"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?",1
"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!",1
"Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!",2
"Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!",0
I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?,2
"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!",0
So what do we do now?,0
"You guys, we have to hurry!",1
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!,1
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.,1
I want you guys to all meet my friend.,1
"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.",1
"Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?",1
Nooohohohohohoho-,1
"What is it, Mr. Hankey?",1
Yes?,1
Nooo!,1
Nooo!,1
Noo! No!,1
"Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.",0
Okay!,0
Uuf.,1
"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach!",0
"No problem, dude.",0
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.,1
"Chef, does poo go to heaven?",1
He's back! He's back!,1
"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.",1
"Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!",2
Selling T-shirts kicks ass!,2
Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you!,1
Behold! Mr. Hankey!,1
No!,1
O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead.,1
What the hell is he doing?,0
Whoa!,2
"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!",1
"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.",0
"Yes. And I've learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.",2
"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!",0
Ow!,0
Are you guys having a meeting or something?,1
"No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.",2
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.,1
Oh weak!,2
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.,1
"Yeah, it's pretty weird.",0
"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.",1
"In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto",2
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.,0
Catch what?,0
"And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto",2
Sshh! Cartman!,0
"Heheheh, buns.",1
"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!",0
Where is the Nintendo?,2
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.,1
"Oh, good. I'm starving.",2
Pfff..!,2
What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?,2
Puh! I heard that.,2
"Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?",2
"Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.",2
"Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?",2
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.,1
"Cartman, what the hell is that?",1
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?,2
"No, it's not cool!",1
"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!",0
"Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!",2
"Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.",2
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.,0
Oh.,0
"Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!",0
"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.",0
"Well, you sure seem happy about it!",0
"But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!",2
"Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!",2
"Ugh. Uunnh.  Ey, give me that!  Ahhhh...",2
More calamine lotion!,2
Yeah. I feel great!,1
"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.",1
Yes. Why?,1
"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!",1
"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.",1
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?,1
"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?",1
"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?",1
Gods and clods?,1
"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!",1
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!,0
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!,0
"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha.",0
"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here!",0
"Could we go home now, Ma?",1
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.,1
"What's ""ookie mouth""?",1
"Sick, dude!",1
"Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!",1
Argh!,1
"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible.",1
"Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!",2
"Oh, no.  Damnit!  No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!  Uh. Yes. Uh...",2
It's about friggin' time! Give me that!,2
"Uugh!  Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh...",2
What the hell does that have to do with American history?,1
"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.",1
"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?",1
Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!,0
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?,0
"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.",0
Wait! Where are you going?,0
Milkshakes?!,0
Weak!,0
"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea.""",1
You!,1
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!,1
"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!",1
"You get away from me, you crazy woman!",1
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.,0
Stan! Stan!,1
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.,0
"Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?",1
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!,1
"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.",1
They did?,0
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.,1
Because they're a bunch of assholes.,1
Of course!,0
"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!",1
"""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool.""  Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool.""",2
"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?",1
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.,2
"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!",0
"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.",1
She what?!,2
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.,0
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!,2
"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.",1
"Chef, we wanna know about herpes.",1
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.,1
How does someone get herpes?,0
Do you know anybody with herpes?,1
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?,0
"Cool! Thanks, Chef!",1
Are you old Frida?,1
Someone who wants a favor.,1
We want you to give our parents herpes.,2
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser.,0
"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.",1
"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.",0
"Thanks a lot, Frida!",0
"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!",1
I don't wanna go back there.,0
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?,0
"You know, freshen up your breath.",0
"Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.",1
Ugh...,1
We're sorry.,1
"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.",1
"Hell no, you guys get your own!",2
Pretty good.,0
"Wow, coo-hul!",0
I'm better now.,1
We gave you guys herpes.,1
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.,0
"Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?",2
Hooray!,2
"Well, I know one thing for sure.",2
We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.,2
"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.",1
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?,0
"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.",0
To where?,1
Planetariums suck!,2
It's boring.,0
"Yeah, all the constellations look alike.",1
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!,2
"Hey, there it is!",2
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!,2
"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!",1
But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!,2
But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!,2
"I thought it was ""plane-tarium.""",1
How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?,2
As if we care.,2
"Hey, who are you?",1
"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?",0
This is stupid.,0
Whoopie.,1
"Aw man, screw this.",2
"Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!",2
Eric Cartman.,2
"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!",2
"Thaat's right, suck on that.",2
"Oh, man, I don't feel so good.",1
"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.",0
Me too. It was sweet.,1
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.,0
I did it! I did it!,2
Did what?,1
I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!,2
"Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!",2
My head still feels funny.,1
"Yeah, mine too.",0
"Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.",2
"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!",1
"It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.",2
"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!",1
"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!",0
"Hey, be careful, asshole!",2
"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!",0
That's a haiku?,0
"Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.",1
Yeah. What's a discharge?,0
"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?",1
"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.",0
"Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?",0
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.,1
"Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.",2
"Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?",2
"Where have you been, Cartman?",0
"Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!",2
"This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.",2
"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.",1
"Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.",2
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?,0
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.,2
"I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.",1
"Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it!",2
"Dude, what just happened?",0
"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.",0
"I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!",2
I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.,2
"Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!",2
Psych!,2
"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-",0
Sshh!,1
"Dude, this isn't right.",0
"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.",0
"Oh, yeah.",1
"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there.",0
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.,1
"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.",0
He hits this switch-,0
"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.",1
"Yeah, I guess so.",0
What does that do?,1
Kenny! What's it doing?,1
"This says ""maximum.""  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!",0
We're bastards!,1
"Dude, I told you something was up with this place!",0
"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!",1
"I know, I know! 
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right",2
Thank you.,2
"I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!",2
Yes! I'm the best!,2
Sweeet!,2
"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.",0
"But it's true, dude!",1
"Yeah, pretty sure.",0
What other crime in South Park?,0
I'm over here.,2
Aay!  Let's hurry. This costume is hot.,2
"I love Cheesy Poofs, you-",2
"Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!",2
I love Cheesy Poofs-,2
"Oh, man, c'mon!",2
"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-",2
"Oh, God damnit!",2
"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!",0
"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!",1
"Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.",2
"I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.",2
"Okay, bye.",2
Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.,2
Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!,2
He's not highly intelligent.,1
"Why are you doing this, dude?",0
"Oh, dude, here it comes!",2
"Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!",2
Mr. Mackey!,0
"Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!  Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!  You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!  Planetariums suck ass!",2
Cartman! You saved us!,1
What the hell are you talking about?,2
Get over here and untie us!,0
Oh my God! Dr. Adams!,0
He got a full dose of the stars.,1
Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.,0
"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.",1
"Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero.",2
"God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!",2
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.,0
What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!,2
"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!",0
Yeah! You're dead!,1
"I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--",2
"No, you don't!",0
"--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.",2
"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!",1
"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!",0
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?,2
Well? Now what are we going to do?,1
Huh-I dunno.,0
"Hi, Wendy.",0
I dunno.,1
...No.,0
We could?,0
"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.",0
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?,0
Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!,2
"Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.",0
We do?,1
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.,0
"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.",1
"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.",0
How do we do it?,0
"Yeah, dude! How'd you know?",0
Dude!,0
"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!",1
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.,0
"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?",1
"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.",0
"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.",1
"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?",0
"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.",0
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!,1
What are you guys doing?,2
We're building a clubhouse.,0
"A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!",2
"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!",1
Wwwhy??,2
"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?",1
"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!",0
That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!,2
Fine!,1
"Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!",2
Fine!,0
Fine!,2
Fine! That's fine.,2
"No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!",2
"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.",2
"No, Kenny.",2
"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!",2
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?,2
"But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!",2
"Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.",2
And stop your bitchin'!,2
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--,0
'Kay.,0
When is Mr. Hat coming back?,1
But Mr. Twig sucks.,0
"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?",2
"Better than yours, fat boy.",0
"We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.",2
Almost.,0
"Yes, Mr. Garrison.",0
"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.",0
"Good guess, dude!",1
Phew.,0
"No, I just--",0
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--,0
But I didn't write the note!,0
"Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.",2
"Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!",0
What's 'skylarkings'?,0
"Oh, no.",0
"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.",0
Excuse me.,0
"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!",2
"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.",2
"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.",2
"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?",2
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.,1
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.,0
To me??,1
"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!",0
"We should use nails, dude.",1
My mom won't let us.,0
Pretty good. We're almost done.,0
We're going as fast as we can!,0
"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.",0
"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?",1
"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?",1
I didn't even think about that.,0
"And I say, ""Dare!""",0
"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her.",0
"""Dare!""",0
You really think so?,0
"What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?  Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?",2
Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!,2
Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?,2
"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?",2
We're working on it.,0
"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.",2
"No, you don't!  Dude!",0
"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.",2
"Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?",0
What?! Why?,0
"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?",0
"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!",0
This is happening way too fast.,0
"Ahaw, that's weak.",2
That's killer.,2
That's totally weak!,2
"Killer weak, sweet!",2
"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!""",2
Okay. We're done.,0
"Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy.",1
"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls.",0
' G'oh?,0
But no! I have to get the girls to come-,0
Weak!  Dad?,0
But I don't understand why we have to--,0
"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?",0
"But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.",0
What? That's it?,0
"I guess, but--",0
"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.",0
"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.",1
"No way, dude! Don't be silly.",0
"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?",0
Right. Why?,1
"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.",0
Too eager to what?,1
"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez.",0
"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?",0
"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.",0
"Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times.",0
Umm. Dare?,1
"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!",1
"It's just wrong, that's all.",1
"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.",0
What the hell have you gotten me into?!,1
"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?",0
Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!,1
Dare.,0
"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!",0
Crap!,0
"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!",2
"Coming, Mom.  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!",2
Who the hell are you?!,2
How many people?,2
"Okay, that's fine.",1
But I don't care.,1
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.,0
My dad lets me watch cartoons.,0
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!,0
"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!",0
Divorce is stupid.,0
"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy.",0
Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?,2
This is bullcrap!,2
"This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!",2
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!",2
Wow. Clubhouses are magical.,0
Dare.,0
"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.",1
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.,0
"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.",1
Wwow!,2
"Dude, that kicks ass!",1
"Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?",2
Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!,2
That's easy!,2
Ay! Check it out!  Damn it!,2
"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!",2
"You suck, Cartman!",1
I'd like to see you do better!,2
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!,1
But ih-,1
"Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!",1
"I only have three dollars left, asshole!",2
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.,1
"Mom, give me some money!",1
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.,1
I will if you give me money!,1
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.,1
"I only need one, dude. I only need one.",2
How much is it?,2
Is it like a- haunted house or something?,1
"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.",2
"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.",1
"Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.",2
"You'd better be right, dude.",1
I'm right!,2
Eh! God-damnit!,2
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!,1
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!,0
I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!,2
"That was a waste of money, Cartman!",1
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.,1
"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!",2
This ride better be good!,1
"Yeah, this line is way too long!",0
I think we're almost to the end.,2
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!,1
Here we go.,0
Finally!,1
What ride?,0
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!,1
My ass we will!,0
"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!",1
"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.",0
"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.",2
"You dumbass, Cartman!",1
What? This is cool.,2
"It is, too!",2
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.,0
"How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!",1
"Aah, three dollars.",2
"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!",1
"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.",2
You son of a bitch! Aaargh!,1
Ey! Seriously!,2
"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!",1
"Well, I'm sorry!",2
"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?",1
Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!,2
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?,0
"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!",1
"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!",1
"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!",2
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.,1
That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!,1
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!,1
"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.",1
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!,1
It worked!,1
"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.",0
"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?",0
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.,1
"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-",1
"Damnit, I have to have those dolls!",1
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.,0
"Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!",1
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?,2
"Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!",1
"O-kay, I'll- get on the bull.",2
"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!",1
He really wants those dolls.,0
"I guess, damn!",2
"Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.",0
"Hey, this is sweet.",2
"You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?",1
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.,2
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.,0
Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!,2
How long was that?,0
That wasn't quite ten seconds.,1
"Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.",0
"You guys, eh seriously, my back!",2
"Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!",1
Seriously. Help.  Screw you guys. Hate you guys.,2
"What'd you say, Cartman??",1
I hate you guys!,2
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.,1
Hate you guys.,2
"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.",1
"Okay, Cartman. You ready?",1
Nnoo.,2
Open the gate!,1
"All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.",2
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!,1
"Yeah, this is sweet!",2
What are you going to do?,0
Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.,1
"Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea.",0
That's better.,1
"Hold on, Cartman!",0
"Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f-",2
"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!",1
"Come on, Cartman.",0
"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP!",1
"You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?",0
"Dude, I think we broke him.",1
What's the matter with him.,0
..Oh.,1
But can he still ride a bull?,0
We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?,1
"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?",0
Boinsure li bonsure.,2
Boyongture taur lur mahrter.,2
"Oh, he's fine, dude.",0
You think?,1
Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.,2
"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.",0
How's he doing?,0
He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.,1
Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.,2
Do you think he can ride the bull?,0
"Yeah, I think so.",1
Cool.,0
"Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!",2
Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.,2
"Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!",2
"Jesus, dude!",0
"Hey, where's Cartman?",1
"Oh, hell!",0
"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.",0
"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!",0
"He's up in, like, twenty minutes!",1
"Hello, fren! Hello!",2
There he is!,0
"Sucky-sucky, five dollar.",2
"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.",1
"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!",0
Hucky-sucky five dollar.,2
"Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!",2
"Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.",0
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.,0
Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!,2
"Hang on, Cartman!",1
"Aaah! Ten dollar!  Ten dollar, soldier boy!",2
Gaaah!  Heeee!,2
"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.",0
"Go help him, Kenny!",1
"Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.",2
"We did it, dude, we did it!",0
Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.,0
How many ball does that get us?,1
Odline daur shunba shunba?,2
You will?,1
"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?",0
"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!",1
Ten dollar? Sucky-sucky?,2
What are we gonna do with them?,1
We should-,0
..What the-?,1
"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!",0
After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!,1
"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!",1
"Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.",0
"Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.",1
"Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?",0
"Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.",2
"Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?",2
Oh-h. Nowhere.,0
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!,2
"No! Cartman, that was just a dream!",1
Oh! Son of a bitch!,2
"Stinky britches, you got stinky britchesStinky, stinky britches, you got stinky--",2
"What the hell are you singing, Cartman?",1
"This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head.Stinky britches, you got stinky britches",2
"Stinky britches, you got stinky, stinky--",2
"Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.",2
"Yeah. Stinky, stinky britches",2
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.,0
"Stinky britches, you got stinky--",2
He'd be better used as a coat rack.,1
"You got stinky britches, stinky--",2
He singing some new hit song.,1
"It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.",2
You wrote it?,2
"Wow, then you should get money for it!",1
"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.",1
It’s the same goddamn song!,1
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!,1
"Yeah, and he’s Jewish.",2
What's a Chewbacca defense?,2
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.,0
"Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, ""Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!""",2
"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.",1
"Wow, he’s good.",2
"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.",0
"Hello there, Chef.",0
"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.",0
"Yeah. Ready, Cartman?",1
"Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--",2
See? I told you guys it would work.,2
"What's that, dude?",1
Did you ever know any famous people?,1
"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.",0
"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.",1
"We've gotta help him, dude.",0
"Yeah, b-but how?",1
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!,0
"Whoa, dude, this house is huge.",1
"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.",0
"No, it isn't, you guys.",2
"We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?",2
Are you Elton John?,1
"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?",1
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.,1
We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies…,2
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--,0
"Yeah, dude.",1
"Wow, you remember him?",0
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?,0
Three Crispy Yum Yums.,2
"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?",0
"Thanks, dude.",0
"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!",1
"Hello, are you Meat Loaf?",0
"Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.",2
"He’s not dying, Cartman!",1
"Shut your goddamn mouth.  We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--",2
"Our friend, Chef.",0
Yeah. Do you know him?,1
Wow! So you'll help him?,0
"Gosh, thanks, Rick James.",1
"Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!",0
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?,0
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.,1
"Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated here.",2
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?,1
You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!,0
Dude… Chef is gone.,1
No more Chef.,0
No more Salisbury steak and… pecan pie.,2
"We can't let him down, you guys.",0
"Dude, it's over. He's gone.",0
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?,0
Four.,2
But what are we gonna do?,1
"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.",0
Chef Aid?,1
"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.",0
"Hey, that's a great idea!",1
"I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay",2
Hmm... This isn't going over so well.,1
"Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!",0
"Would you like sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut, Fräulein Setski",2
Elton John! What are you doing here?,0
"Boy, do we!",0
"Wow, cool!",1
"Yeah, dude, it's all yours.",0
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!,1
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!,2
"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?",0
"Well, we helped.",1
"We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.",0
"Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!",0
"Hey, that's your song for Wendy!",1
"Ha-ha, you're a wuss.",2
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.,0
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.,1
Hey guys. How's it going?,2
"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?",1
"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?",0
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?,1
"You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.",2
"I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed.  I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.",2
"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!",1
"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.",0
"Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?",2
"Dude, this is creepy.",0
"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!",0
I don't like it. It's spooky.,0
Do I have to?,0
Damn it!,0
"Where have you been, dude?",1
"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.",0
Aunt Flo?,1
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.,0
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.,1
"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.",0
Here he comes.,1
"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?",0
"Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!",2
"You said you could get us money, Cartman!",1
"Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!",2
"Well, at least he's back to normal.",1
"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!",0
It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.,1
"Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!",2
"Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!",0
"'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.",2
That's not cool!,1
You guys are just hella jealous.,2
"Can you leave the light on, Dad?",0
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.,0
Where did it go?  Huhhh.,0
"Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to.",2
Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom!,0
"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!",0
AAAAAAAAH!,0
The fish!  But-.,0
WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!,0
"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.",0
You're not gonna get away with this!,0
"Mom, what are you doing?",0
"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!",0
But MOM!,0
MMOOMM!,0
"No, mom!",0
"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?",1
"Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!",2
"It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!",2
"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.",1
I haven't been sleeping so well.,0
"God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull!",2
"God, will you shut up?!",1
"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?",0
"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?",0
"I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.",1
"No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys.",2
"You seem tired, Stan.",1
I haven't been sleeping well.,0
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.,0
"Hoh, that sucks, dude.",1
"Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.",2
"Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!",2
What are you doing?!,0
"What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.",2
"You can't be standing there, Cartman.",1
Why the hell not?!,2
Because you're standing over there!,1
Aaah! Son of a bitch!,2
I can't believe what I'm seeing.,2
"Dude, this is hella weird.",2
We have problems!,1
"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.",0
"...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!",2
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.,2
Will you stop saying that word?!,1
"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!",0
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?,1
"Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.",0
"Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.",2
"Dude, this is hella cool.",2
"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?",0
Do you remember what pet store?,0
"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.",0
"Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!",2
"Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!",2
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.,1
"Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!",0
It was the fish!,0
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!,0
"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude.",1
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.,0
"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.",1
Screw you!,2
"Come on, we're running out of time.",0
"Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!",2
"Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny!",2
"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!",2
"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!",2
"NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!!  Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.",2
"Yeah, my goldfish-.",0
"Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!",0
I wanna return a fish.,0
"Yeah, dude.",0
"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?""",1
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?,0
"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.",0
"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.",0
"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!",0
"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!",0
"You kick ass, evil Cartman!",1
"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him!",1
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.,0
"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.",1
"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.",0
"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella.""",1
"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?",1
"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.",0
"Aw, man, this movie is hella scary.",2
"P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?",2
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?,2
What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum.  I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.,2
Don't touch me!,2
"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!",2
"Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you.",2
"We won, dude!",0
"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us!",0
"Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!",2
"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!",1
"Leave him alone, butthole!",1
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.,0
"Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!",2
It's the evil pets,1
Get to the stage!,0
"Up yours, evil twin!",0
"All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!",2
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya.,0
"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe!",1
Which one is the good Cartman?,1
"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!",0
"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!",1
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.,0
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!,2
"Oh no, dude!",1
"You tricked us, Cartman!",0
"That's right, I did!You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella!",2
"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!",0
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?,0
I don't want your lame-ass supper!,0
Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway!,0
"Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.",2
"That's nice, Cartman.",1
"Okay, let's go!",0
"Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.",2
"'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!",0
"Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun!  Kenny, I called it shotgun!  Dammit, Kenny, get in the back!  Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there.  Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade!  Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! , Go get it!  ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap.",2
"So, how far is it to Nebraska?",0
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?,1
"Yeah. Or, we could not.",0
"Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?",2
Please stop.,1
Please stop!,1
"I guess, damn!",2
This is Nebraska?,0
What's all that stuff?,1
"We don't care, Mom.",2
"Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!",1
"Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?",0
"I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.",1
"Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.",2
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!,1
How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.,2
Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!,2
"Oh, God!",1
Over the meadow and through the woods...,2
"Jesus Christ, finally!",1
Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma!,2
"Hi, Grandpa!",2
Sweet. What is it?,2
Yes! Move it!,2
He's the fat one.,0
"I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.",2
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.,1
"Sick, dude.",0
"Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?",2
"Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt!",2
"Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!",2
"Yeah, right!",0
My family's dead!,0
"Dude, your family died?",1
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.,0
I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!,2
What is this??,1
"Hi, cousin Elvin.",2
"Whoa, dude!",1
"Dude, is he here every year like this?",0
Yup!,2
Aaww!,1
Amen.,2
"Jesus, dude!",1
Bad Jimmy!,2
"Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.",0
I know what you mean.,1
Arrggh!,1
"What, dude?",0
"Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!",1
"Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.",0
Oh. Arrggh!,1
"I heard it, too.",1
"Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was that for!",2
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming.,0
"I wanted to make sure, too.",1
"Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!",2
"Dude, it's coming through the window!",1
Uncle Howard!,2
"Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!",2
We thought you were in jail.,0
"Wow, cool!",2
Okay.,2
Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.,2
"Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.",0
"We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.",1
"All right, keeps your pants on.",2
Okay.,2
Can somebody drive us to the mall?,2
"Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?",2
"Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?",2
"Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!",2
Damn his Goddamned authorituh!,2
I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!,2
All right. Give me $10.,2
My family sucks ass!,2
"Yeah, they do!",1
All families suck ass!,0
Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns.,2
"Dude, we have to get to the mall!!",1
"My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.",2
"Good for you, Charlie!",1
Do you really think we should go with this guy?,0
"Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people.",2
Do you see him?,1
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.,0
I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!,1
"That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.",1
How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff.,2
And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!,2
So?!,1
"So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?",2
"Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants.",1
I really like that guy.,0
"Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin.  God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin!  No, Elvin, bad Elvin!",2
"Hoh, boy. Here we go!",1
Mr. Hankey?,0
You're not the real Mr. Hankey.,1
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.,0
This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake!,1
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?,1
What?! What did you say?!,1
"Oh, boy. You've done it now.",0
Behold! Here's your false prophet!,1
I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!,2
It was a fake!,1
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!,1
"Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?",0
"Oh, uh that's pretty cool.",2
Hey. Where's Kenny?,0
"Oh, hey Kenny.",0
Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously.,2
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!,2
"I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!",1
"God, I hate the holiday season!",1
Lock the door!,2
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!,0
Oh ooh.,0
"What's your mom doing here, dude?",1
...Sorry.,0
"Dude, they're gonna kill me.",0
'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.,0
"Please, I don't wanna go back with them.",0
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.,0
"But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.",0
"I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks.",0
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.,1
"See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.",2
"I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.",0
"Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?",0
That's okay with us.,0
"Yeah, that's fine.",2
"Oh, not Tweek.",0
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.,1
"Dude, we can't work with this kid.",0
"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--",0
"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about.",0
"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.",2
"No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?",1
"Great. A lot of help you are, kid.",0
What gnomes?,0
"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.",2
"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.",1
"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.",0
"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.",1
We're his oral report buddies.,1
"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.",0
Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.,1
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.,0
"Wow, that sucks, dude.",0
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.,1
"Come on, you guys! We better get to work!",1
"Man, this stuff is strong.",1
Kind of bitter.,0
Don't worry about it.,1
"Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?",2
"Heheh, you suck, Kenny.",2
"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.",1
Aooooo!,0
Woohoo!,1
"Yeess, this stuff rocks!",0
"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!",1
Whoopee!,0
"You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.",2
"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?",1
Killer!!,1
"Ey, let me have some grounds.",2
"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!",1
"Hogh, my stomach hurts.",1
"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.",0
"Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.",1
"Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!",0
Bad!,0
No...more...coffee. Blech.,2
"No, we'll use it.",0
Sure.,1
"Thanks, dude.",1
"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!",0
"Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!",1
"""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...",1
"What will become of the endeavoring American family?""",2
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.,0
"And that's our report, I guess.",1
Neither did we.,2
Huh??,0
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.,1
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?,1
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.,1
My butt hurts.,1
Our case?,0
"Aw, man, this sucks!",2
Uh... Hooray.,0
Uh...,1
Uh...,0
This guy sucks ass!,2
I don't like big corporations.,1
I like small businesses.,0
I believe in the family-owned enterprise.,2
What now?,2
"Oh, God, when is this gonna end?",1
"Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!",0
So what are we gonna say?,1
Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?,2
"'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!",0
Does anybody know anything about corporations?,1
I think my mom is a corporation.,2
"Yeah, that makes sense.",0
"Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?",1
How do we stretch that into five minutes?,0
"Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!",1
What the hell?,0
"Well, I'll be damned.",2
"Sshh, don't scare him.",1
"Hey there, little guy.",0
Bad!,2
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!,1
"Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him.",2
What?!,2
"Hey, he talks!",0
"Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!",2
"Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?",0
"Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.",1
"Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?",0
Show us.,1
"Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.",2
"Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?",2
"Oh, your pussy village?",2
"Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?",0
I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.,2
"Damn, dude, this place is huge!",0
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.,1
"No it isn't, you guys!",2
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?,2
"Sooo, what's phase 2?",1
I don't get it.,0
"Oh, I get it.",2
"No you don't, fatass!",0
Do you guys know anything about corporations?,1
"You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.",1
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.,0
Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?,0
Underpants?,0
"Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.",0
Big corporations are good!,1
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.,1
"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!",0
"Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time.",1
I love you guys.,2
Holy crap. dude!,0
"Go, dude, go!",1
This guy rules!,0
I told you guys.,2
Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!,1
Yeah!,0
"There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!",2
"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!",1
"Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!",2
"Get away from me, Cartman!",1
"Come 'ere, crocky.",2
AAAAAAAAAA!,1
HELP!,1
"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!",0
"Well, he shouldn't have called me fat.",2
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!,0
"Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles!",2
You guuuys!,1
"Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay?",0
I think so. Is Cartman up there?,1
"I'm right here, Kyle.",2
"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.",1
"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!",2
"Can you climb back up, dude?",0
I don't think so.,1
"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.",0
"Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.",2
"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.",0
"Sick, dude!",1
"Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?!",0
"Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.",1
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?,0
"Dude, it's a dude!",1
"He's like, some frozen guy.",0
"Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!",2
"Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.",0
Wow. Cool.,1
"You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!",0
"Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.",2
Help me chip some of the ice away.,0
"Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about ""Greased Lightning.""  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-",2
"Aww, screw you guys anyway!",2
"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?",0
"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!",1
For what?,2
Where shall we bring it?,0
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.,1
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.,0
"No, dude! We have to name it Steve.",1
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve?,0
"It's my name, and I found him.",1
"You didn't find him, I found him.",0
"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!",1
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.,0
"Kenny, who found the ice man?",1
"I think we're almost there, you guys.",2
"Huh, excuse me?",0
But we found a frozen ice man from the past!,1
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.,0
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.,1
We came for our reward.,1
"Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.",2
Really.,0
Sweet. How about Steve?,1
Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!,0
"Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope-",1
"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.",0
Gorak's a gay name.,1
"No, it isn't!",0
Why are you being such a dick?,1
"I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!",0
Nuh-uh!,1
I'll go.,1
"No, I'll go! I found him!",0
"Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!",2
"Oh my God, they revived Gorak.",0
Uh. Hi.,0
"He said, ""hi.""",0
He wants to know where he is.,0
You're... home.,0
"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.",0
"Good job, dude! You freaked him out!",1
"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him.",0
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!,1
"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!",0
Killer.,2
Fine!,1
He doesn't look very happy in there.,0
"No, he sure doesn't.",1
"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!",0
"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!",1
"Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.",2
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.,0
He's my creature!,1
"Let him out, dude. He's scared.",0
But it isn't right!,1
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!",0
What?! I'm not talking to you!,1
Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?,0
"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.",0
I'm here to bust out Steve.,1
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.,0
His name is Steve!,1
His name is Gorak!,0
Steve!,1
Gorak!,0
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!,0
"Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man",1
No he doesn't!!,0
Does so!,1
"I found him, I'm rescuing him!",0
You're a dick!,0
You're a dick!,1
"You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!",0
"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!",1
"Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!",0
"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?",1
"Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.",0
"Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick!",1
"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait.",0
"Well, I don't see any crocs out here.",2
"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!",0
"Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!",2
"You suck as a best friend, Cartman!",0
You son of a bitch cat!,2
"What are you doing, Gorak!",0
"Steve, wait!",1
"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!",0
"I've got something to show Steve, dick!",1
"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!",0
"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!",1
"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you.",1
"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!",1
"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!",0
"No you don't, butthole!",1
Come on!,0
"Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.",2
"He might have been, by crikey.",2
Wow! Kick ass!,2
"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.",0
"We have to get our friend, Steve-",1
"My friend, Gorak!",0
"No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!",0
"Frosty, Steve, whatever.",1
"Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.",0
"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.",1
"Okay. First one to die, loses.",1
Okay.,1
O-okay.,0
"So, here we go.",1
'K,0
Go.,1
"Yeah, I think the same thing.",2
"Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.",2
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.,2
Ow!,1
"Watch my coat, dude.",0
Oh.,1
"Oh. Okay, it's over this way",1
"No problem, Gorak.",0
Later.,1
Uhuh.,1
Right on.,0
Cool.,1
His... name... is... Gorak!,0
His name... is Steve!,1
"Steve! Steve, look out!",1
They're after you!,0
"Steve, look out!",1
"They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.",2
Where's Gorak??,0
I can't believe he's gone.,1
"Wait, look! The helicopter!",0
He's alive!,0
"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.",0
"No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.",1
"Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.",2
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.,0
"Me, too. He sucks.",1
"Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha! There's a king croc right there!  And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-",2
"Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.",2
What if you don't have any rhythm?,2
"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.",2
"Shut up, fatass!",1
Choirs suck.,0
"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper.",2
"Hey, Craig.",1
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.,0
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.,1
You can't do that!,1
But we don't even care about the rainforest.,0
"Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.",2
"Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.",2
"Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!",0
Nooo-ho!,0
Whoopee.,2
"Yeah, pretty much.",2
The nightmare begins.,2
"Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!",2
"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!",2
"Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.",2
"Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!",2
Okay.  Kugheek!,2
"Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.",2
"I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.",2
"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!",2
Eh-heheh!,2
Thanks!,1
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!,2
"Fuck off, Cartman!",1
"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.",0
No! That's a stereotype.,1
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm.,0
"God-damn, it's hot out here!",1
Aaah! Snake!,0
"No, dude. That's a branch.",1
Oh.  Aaah! Snake!,0
No. That's the same branch again.,1
"Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.",2
Bad! Bad monkey!,2
"I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, ""Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!"" and I smack him on the head!",2
It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!,2
Respect my authoritah!,2
What's the Yanogapa?,1
"Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!",2
AAAAAAA!,0
SNAAAKE!,0
"He's a little wuss, what's it look like?",2
I'm just a-scared of snakes.,0
"Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!",2
My guess would be 'yes.',1
Bad! That's a bad snay-ah!,2
"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!",0
"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!",1
"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.",1
"Um, no.",1
Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!,1
Aaaaa! There's a dude here!,1
"Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos.",2
"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.",0
Y taco.,2
I want two tostadas and mild sauce.,1
Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.,2
This doesn't look very safe.,0
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.,1
This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.,2
I'm going this way!,2
"Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah.",2
"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.",2
God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved!,2
Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.,0
Yeah. It happened once before.,1
Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!,2
"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!",2
Food! I have to have food!,2
Chicken wings.,2
Medium spicy.,2
"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke?",0
"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people.",1
Holy crap!,0
What the hell?,1
We're sinking.,0
"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!",0
Yeah! Fragile my ass!,1
"Oh, now she figures it out.",0
Dude! Bulldozers rule!,1
Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?,2
They did.,0
"You know, ""they.""",0
They're... they're bastards.,1
Help ...him?,0
"Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?",0
"No, I don't think so.",1
"No, that's a hair dryer!",1
"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?",1
I need to get a nurection for my dad.,1
Why is that funny?,0
"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody?",1
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?,0
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.,1
"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?",2
"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-",2
What the hell happened to him?,2
He just... ignited.,0
"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.",0
"Wow, that was short.",0
"Well, I'm Jewish.",1
I guess not.,1
The what?,0
"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!",1
We'll do it! We'll do it!,1
"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?",1
"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.",0
"Dad, where's our Bible?",0
Or else what?,0
Where's our Bible?,0
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.,1
"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?",0
"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection.",0
"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.",0
This is gonna be fun.,1
I'm gonna be Jesus!,2
You're too fat to be Jesus!,1
"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!",2
Stan should be Jesus.,1
"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home!",2
You're such a fat baby!,1
"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves.",2
"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!",1
"Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.",2
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.,0
Die!,1
"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.",2
Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.,0
"This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.",2
"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him.",0
Peter!,2
"I don't know you, dude.",1
"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.",2
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross.,0
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.,2
"Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks.""",0
"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool.",2
"And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.",0
"Hi, mom.",2
"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.",1
"Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.",2
"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!",1
Up your ass with broken glass!,2
This spot looks good.,0
Yeah. That looks pretty good.,1
"Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.",0
"Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!",2
"Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.",0
"Yeah, me too.",1
"Well, get me down from here!",2
"Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.",1
"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.",0
Then I can give it to my dad.,1
"Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!",2
"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.",0
"Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.",1
"Wow, he died.",0
"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.",1
"Hey, there you guys are!",2
Cartman??,0
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!,2
"How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!",1
"You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!",2
"Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.",0
...Really?,2
"Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap!",1
"...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.",2
"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!",1
Jesus Christ!,1
"(Sick, dude!)",0
"(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)",1
"(Okay, okay, just go away!)",0
"God, that was not cool at all, dude!",1
Uh. We've been taking care of him.,0
Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.,1
Apples?,0
(Dude!),0
(Sick!),1
(I don't think I like this new law.),0
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.,1
"You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!",2
Officer Barbrady!,2
"Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.",2
"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!",0
"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.",1
"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.",1
"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!",1
"Dude, he's still not dead.",0
"You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.",2
She's not worried about you.,1
"Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.",2
That's not your mom calling!,0
"Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.",2
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!,1
"You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!",2
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.,0
"Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.",1
"Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my ""I hate Stand and Kyle"" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...",2
Hey you guys. Seriously.,2
Chef! Chef!,2
"Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!",2
"Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!",2
"Oh, damnit!",2
"Dad, where's the phone book?",0
"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?",0
"Uh, it... sucks ass.",0
"Oh my God, what's going on?",0
"Yeah, take that!",1
"Dude, that's my dad!",0
"...Oh, yeah. Sorry.",1
"Dude, those people are pissed!",1
"I know, huh?",0
Where's your dad?,1
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.,0
"Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.",1
"What are you doing, dad?",0
"No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!",0
"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!",0
"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.",0
"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.""",0
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime.,0
"Dude, that was Star Trek again.",1
"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.",1
"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?",0
Dad. Dad!,0
"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!",0
She's upstairs.,1
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore.,1
Hello-o.,2
See? My dad is the coolest after all.,0
"Well, my dad is, too.",1
I forgot all about him.,1
"He's been up there for like, three weeks.",0
That's amazing!,0
"Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.",2
"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?",1
Get me down from here!,2
"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?",0
"Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.",2
"Mom, please can we just leave?",2
But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.,2
"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.",2
Weak.,2
"Hi, Doctor Lout.",2
Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!,2
"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!",2
I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!,2
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!,2
They look exactly the same.,2
"I don't know, two!",2
"Uh, one.",2
Two.,2
Ow! I hate you!,2
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?,1
"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.",0
"Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.",1
"Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman?",0
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.,2
"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!",2
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?,0
"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.",2
"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.",1
"Hey, yeah!  Ow!",2
"Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.",2
Where's Chef?,0
Mr. Derp?,1
Why did Chef quit?,0
Could you just hand us some food please?,0
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?,2
Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!,1
"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.",0
"I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny.",2
"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.",0
"Yeah, but we didn't believe them.",1
But why? Why would you quit?,0
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.,0
Talked?!,0
"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!",0
Moving in?!,1
What the hell is going on?!,0
"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.",1
"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.",2
This... is insane.,1
That bitch!,1
She's stealing Chef from us.,0
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.,1
Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.,2
"Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new?",0
"Yeah, so?",1
"...Yeah, screw that bitch.",0
"Bitch, I hate that bitch!",2
"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.",1
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.,0
Good idea.,1
Stop calling me piggy!,2
"So, what does that mean?",2
"All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!",2
"Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.",2
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!,2
Ow! Son of a bitch!,2
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings,1
Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!,2
Dude! Just take them off!,1
I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.,2
We wanna talk to Chef.,0
"He's a big guy, with a beard.",1
And a chef hat.,0
"Uh, yeah, sure sure.",2
"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!",0
"We need you, Chef.",1
"Chef, this place isn't you!",1
But we don't like her.,0
I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.,0
"No way, dude!",1
"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.",2
Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!,2
Chef should be here any minute.,1
Dude! He bailed on us!,0
I can't believe it!,1
Come on! We're going to his house!,0
"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!",1
You forgot!,0
"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!",1
"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?",2
Oh no! No nononononono!,0
"Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?",1
"Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.",0
"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?",1
What's a succubus?,0
That's it!,1
This is totally what's happening!,1
"Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!",0
"Thanks, Mr. Garrison.",1
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.,1
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.,0
"Oh, no!",2
"Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.",2
But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!,2
"Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.",1
There he is!,1
"Chef, we have to talk to you!",0
You're Chef's parents?,0
We have to talk to him!,1
"No, that's okay.",0
What's tree-fitty?,1
He wanted money?,0
Hey! You son of a bitch!,2
"Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh",2
"Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?",0
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!",0
That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!,2
"Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.",0
"Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?",2
"Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.",0
Aaah! It's the succubus!,2
"We know what you are, lady!",0
Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!,1
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!,0
"Well, you are taking Chef from us.",1
Jesus dude!,0
What? What happened?,2
"Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news.",0
This is not a woman! It is a succubus!,1
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him,0
"Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!",1
"Chef, but-",0
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.,1
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!,0
"Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.",0
"You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.",2
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.,0
"You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep.",2
"Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.""",1
Right.,0
Oh-hoho!,0
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.,1
"If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...",2
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.,0
In three hours.,1
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.,1
"We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman??",0
He's asleep. Wake up fatass!,1
What what what?,2
God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.,0
"I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!",2
There she is!,0
Bitch. Bitch.,0
Bitch.,1
Bitch.,0
Dirty bitch.,1
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.,0
Here it goes.,0
"Now, Cartman!",0
"Now, Cartman!!",1
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!!,1
Ow!,2
Oh no! The tape jammed!,2
Come on Cartman!,0
I can't see anything!,2
Oh my God! She killed Kenny!,0
Got it!,2
"We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!",0
What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?,2
We'd love them!,0
It's great to have you back Chef!,1
"After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!",2
"No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!",2
Eh-sure.,2
"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?",0
Ooooohh.,2
Mr. Adler?,1
Tweek is!,0
"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble",1
"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.",2
Told ya!,2
"Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.",1
"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.",0
I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class?,2
I don't know. He's such a wuss.,0
"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is.",2
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.,0
"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.",2
Do you wanna bet?,1
"Yeah, I'll bet.",2
How much?,0
Five bucks.,2
You're on!,0
Hey Tweek.,0
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.,0
"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?",0
"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?",1
"Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.",2
"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.",2
"I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.",2
"No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.",2
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.,1
"He's really got it out for you, dude.",0
"So, do you agree to fight him after school?",1
Super. See you there.,0
Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!,0
The bell rang. Can we go?,0
"Come on, you guys.",0
"This is gonna be so sweet, dude.",0
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.,2
We'll see!,1
Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!,2
"You're on, fatass!",0
"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!",2
"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?",0
"Yeah. That's not cool, dude.",1
Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.,1
"Aw, hell!",0
Those sons of bitches!,2
"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!",1
Tweek?,0
Tweek?,1
"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!",0
"Well, Craig showed up.",1
"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!""",0
"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!",1
"Yeah, it was weak.",0
"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya.",1
Tomorrow?,0
"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!",2
"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!",2
"Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.",2
"Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.",2
"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.",2
"Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?",2
"After Red Racer, of course.",2
"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.",0
"However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.",2
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!,1
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.,2
"Shut up, fatass!!",1
"Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch!",2
"When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.",2
"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!",1
"Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.",2
Tweek's gonna fight Craig!,1
"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.",0
"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.",1
"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.",2
"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby.",1
Well?,0
Come on!,2
"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.",2
How??,1
"Aw, dude, come on!!",0
"You just hit each other, smack each other around.",2
Not like that!,1
"All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.",0
"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.",0
"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.",2
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!",0
"Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!",2
Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!,0
Fine!,2
"Fine, that's fine!",2
"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!",1
"I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool.",2
Respect my authoritah!,2
"Dude. Come on, now. Come on.",2
I win!,2
"Hey, maybe.",2
"Okay, the time has finally come.",0
"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.",1
"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.",1
The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?,2
"Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!",2
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!,0
"Come on, Craig!",2
Ye-hah!,0
"Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass!",2
"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!",1
"Come on, Tweek! You got him!",0
"Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?",1
Craig just called you a boner!,1
We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.,1
Here they are.,0
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching.,0
'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.,2
"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.",0
"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?",0
"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.",0
"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other.",1
"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.",2
"Boy, do we ever.",1
"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies.",0
"Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.",0
"Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.",2
"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.",1
"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!",2
"You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
I hate him the most.
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.",2
"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,...",1
Where are you going?,0
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.,2
Just go behind a tree.,1
I have to go number two.,2
So? You can poo in the wilderness.,0
"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?",2
"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!",1
Well what do I sit on?,2
"You just squat, stupid!",1
Not here! Go further away!,0
"God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.",2
Watch out for ground eels!,1
"Stop, you guys! I can't think!",2
What do you have to think about?,1
"I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.",2
"Sick, dude!",0
"Poopin' outside,
Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?",2
What the?,2
"Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!",2
"We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!",0
"You guys, get over here!",2
I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes.,2
I see it!,0
Come on! Let's kill it!,2
"Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!",1
I saw it this way!,0
Over here!,1
"Come on, you guys!",2
"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!",0
It just ran by here a second ago.,1
"Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.",2
It's stupid.,1
No! No. Don't.,2
I like it.,2
"You don't like anything, Cartman!",1
Wow! Cool!,2
I think his name is Junjun.,0
"Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??",2
"Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door.",2
Should I get it?,2
"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!",2
You mean the other jakovasaur?,2
You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.,2
But the other jakovasaur talked different.,2
I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.,2
"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left.",2
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?,1
"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!",2
Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?,0
"No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in.",2
"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.",2
"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?",2
"No, he's annoying.",0
What are we supposed to do with him?,1
We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.,2
Why don't we just tell our parents?,0
No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.,2
Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.,0
"Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!",0
"Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!",1
"Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.",2
"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?",0
"""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor...""",2
"What are you doing, fatass?!",1
"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor...""",2
"Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.",2
"You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!",2
"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!",1
God-damn!,0
Shut up!!,1
"Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?",0
"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.",1
"If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.",2
"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was.",1
"Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!",2
Gross!,1
"Aren't they cute, you guys?",2
Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.,0
"Dude, it's crowded in here.",0
"Dude, this sucks ass!",1
I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool.,2
"Hey, Jakov, how's it going?",2
Moving?,2
You... can't leave. You're my friend.,2
"Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.",2
"Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?",2
"Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys!",2
Yes. Who would take care of them?,2
I have authoriteh?,2
"Well, that should be fine, just fine.",2
"Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!",0
"Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?",2
"Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready.",2
"What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.",2
"Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.",0
"We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.",1
"Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.",2
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.,1
"That's Kenny with branches on his head.  Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys?",2
"Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.",0
"Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix!",2
Cartman! Wait!,1
Jakov!,2
Open this door!,2
"I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah!  No! Jakov, don't go!",2
Come... back.,2
"Don't, mother! Just, don't.",2
No. That's okay. I'll see you guys.,2
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.,1
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.,0
About what?,1
"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.",2
"This is freaking me out, dude.",1
"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!",0
I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.,2
"You would think that, you little ass-sucker.",0
What did you call me?,2
"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.",0
That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!,2
You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.,2
"No you can't, you little ass-sucker!",0
"Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!",2
"Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.",2
Dude! He got a lawyer?,1
Dad?!,1
"Th... That is correct, my honor.",2
"Hoh, whatever!",0
He talked about having oral sex with my ass.,2
I called you an ass-sucker!,0
"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes.",2
"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!",0
Wwhat do you mean?,0
Uh... I'm eight?,0
I have to give him half my stuff?,0
Sweet..!,2
"Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll.  And, let's see...  Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?",2
"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.",0
"Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?",2
"Uh, no! I hate that toy!",0
"Oh, then you won't mind if I take it!",2
Damnit!,0
Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.,2
"What? But uh, why should I sue the school?",2
"Interesting.  Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that.",2
"It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah",2
It's... big.,1
"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?",1
And you don't see a problem with that?,1
"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?",1
Where's our desks?,0
"You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?",0
"All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!",2
This is ridiculous!,2
"Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!",2
Oh my God! You guys have to do something!,2
"Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?",0
"I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.",1
"Hey, what about that stupid panda?",1
"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!",0
"'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.",0
We want Sexual Harassment Panda.,0
"Well, where is he?!",0
What the hell is wrong with these people?!,0
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?,1
"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!",1
"Hoh God, here we go.",1
Isn't that fascism?,1
Do you?,1
'Scuse me.,0
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.,0
...Coats?,0
"Dude, what the hell is going in?!",0
"Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?",2
"Well, we don't take kindly to you!",0
Where's that?,2
"Come on, we'd better hurry.",0
"""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place.",0
Whoa! Who are you?,0
"...Thanks a lot, dude.",0
I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.,2
Have you seen any panda bears?,0
You bastards!  Hey! There he is!,1
"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!",0
"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!",1
"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.",0
"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume!",1
"Okay, sorry, sorry.",1
"You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.",2
"Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.",0
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.,1
Wait!,1
"No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.",0
"I will! James West, cowboy and rap star!  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!",2
"Are you okay, Salma Hayek?",2
"Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!  Bang! Bangbang!  Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang!  We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch...",2

"No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty!",2
Uh-huh.,2

"Aw, Ma.",2
Jesus Christ.,2
"Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!  Ow!",2
You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV?,2
You're not allowed to have people over!,2
This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!,2
"God damnit!  Shut up, Kitty!  Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha!  I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd!",2
Damnit!,2

Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah!,2
"I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!!  SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!!",2
"They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!",2

You know this guy?,2
"Christ, he's like 50 years old!",2
"Dude, that's not cool.",2
"Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit!",2
"Hey, what are you doing?",2
I'm gonna tell my mom on you.,2
Ey! You ate all the pizza!,2
"That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass!",2
Give me that phone number!,2
I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.,2
"God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip.",2
"Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip.",2
"Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!",2
Aaaaa!  Yes!,2
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!,2
You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!,2
"What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog?",2
"Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty!",2
Oh! God damnit!,2
Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!,2
You just want me to open the door!,2
What?? Ih- is she okay?,2
Huh?!,2
"Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!",2
"Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!",2
"O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH!",2

"Testing, testing, 1 2.  Sweet.",2
Okay. See you in a while.,2
"Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.",2
"Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.",2
"No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.",2
"Yuh, you mean it?",2
"Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.",2
"Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.",2
"That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.",2
"I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?",2
"I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!",2
Gotcha!,2
"Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!",2
"Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?",2
You're not ugly.,2
"Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?",2
"Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.",2
"If you want, I could help you.",2
Just let me get my cowboy hat.,2
"Okay, it's clear.",2
We don't have much time!,2
Hurry up in there!,2
That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!,2
Oh my God!,2
"You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!",2
"Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on.  That's it. Come on, come on.  Uh oh.",2
Yeah. I think we get along okay.,2
Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!,2
"Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.",2
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West.,2
"Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's

Well... mm-Rumpertumskin.",2
I don't want to go to this stupid party!,0
"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.",0
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody,0
Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!,0
"No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!",0
"Butters, is there any way out of here?",0
Oh my God.,0
Yes.,0
"Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.",0
"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!",0
What do I have to do?,0
"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.",0
"What, Pip?",0
What the hell do you want?!,0
You did?,0
We're going upstairs.,0
"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs!",0
"Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.",0
"I don't care, just hurry!",0
Rad!,0
There are no more missions. I have everything I want.,0
Just... play something else! God!,0
"Whoa, cool!",0
Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!,0
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them.,0
"Mom, go look outside.",0
"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves.",0
We don't have any weapons.,0
Get back inside!,0
"Dad! Dad, they shot at us.",0
Mom!,0
"Get a hold of yourself, man!",0
Come on. We have to find out what's happening.,0
Sh!,0
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.,0
"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real.",0
Tell them not to burn us down.,0
Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.,0
"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job.",0
"Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?",0
"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there.",0
"Can you hit a target, Pip?",0
Hit something nice and solid now.,0
"Nice job, Pip.",0
"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn.",0
He made it down.,0
"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.",0
Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.,1
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!,0
"Hoh, dude, weak.",1
Super weak.,0
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me.,1
"I'm coming, Ma!",1
"""Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind!",1
"Oh! Hey, Kenny.",1
"I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.",1
"It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.",1
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.,1
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?,1
...Oh. Kenny isn't special?,1
Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.,1
"Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.",1
"No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!",1
"No, Ike!",1
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.,1
What? You want me to lie?,1
"Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--",1
"Wow, cool.",1
He was huge.,1
"You have to go with him, Ike.",1
"Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building.",1
Kyle Broflovski.,1
"Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.",1
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.,1
"That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand.",1
"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up.",1
"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.",1
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.,1
"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!",1
"Shh. Shut up, Kenny.",1
"That's Moses, stupid!",1
It's a duck.,1
Don't worry. I know what to do.,1
"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.",1
He doesn't get cake?,1
"Dude, what the hell is going on?!",1
"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.",1
Kenny will find a way.,1
"Go, Ike!",1
Kenny! Noooooo!,1
"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.",1
"No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!",2
"No, Kitty!",2
"No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?",2
Hooray!,2
Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!,2
Mom! Mom!,2
"Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!",2
Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!,2
"Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store.",2
"...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.",2
"...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!",2
Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon.,2
"Oh, god damnit!",2
"Hey, fat ass.",0
"Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.",2
"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.",0
"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it.",2
C'mon.,2
"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--",2
C'mon. Give me Pengin!,2
C'mon!,2
"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.",2
"God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!",2
Hey dudes.  What are those?,1
What are these? They're Chinpokomon!,0
You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.,2
"No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.",1
"Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.",2
"Yeah, like ancient history.",0
Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?,1
"No, dude!",0
"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.",2
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!,1
It's all Chinpokomon now.,2
"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.",0
What's the Primary Main Objective?,1
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?,2
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.,0
"Well, what's the Evil Power?",1
Ogh..!,0
"Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!",2
Duhhh!,2
"Yeah, get with the times, dude.",0
Shit!,1
"Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?",1
I'm not sure.,1
"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.",1
"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.",1
Thanks.,1
Neither do I.,1
Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!,1
"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.",2
"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?",0
Huh? No.,1
"Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist!",2
Damnit!,1
"Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!",0
Cool! This game rules!,2
I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...,2
"Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and...",2
"How's it goin', fat ass?",0
I haven't made any money yet.,2
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?,0
Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!,2
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure.,0
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller!,1
"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!",2
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.,0
Camp?,1
The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.,2
You didn't know that?,0
"No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight?",1
"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?",0
"Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?",1
"Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!",2
"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore.",0
"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?",1
"Like, eight days ago.",2
God damnit!,1
Get outta the way! Move it!,2
Can you see anything?,0
"It's starting, it's starting!",0
...our hearts.  Kenny?,1
...Power.,1
Ohhh.,2
Destroy it?,1
Is this cool or not? I can't tell.,2
Juuhachi desu ka?,0
"Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.",0
"Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana.",2
"He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa.""",0
"Minata! Kite kite, churi...",2
...Gay.,2
"Yeah, dude. That was totally gay.",0
Gay.,2
Totally gay.,0
Liberace gay.,1
Kore wa watashi no uchi desu.,0
Nan da kore?,0
You like it?,0
"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.",2
"No.  Screw this, dude.",0
"Where are you going, Stan?",2
"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something.",0
"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes.",2
"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?",0
Owatta Beikoku!,1
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!,1
"Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.",0
"Yeah, dude, that's way over.",2
"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!",1
"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.",0
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?,1
...Ye-eah.,0
"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya.",1
"Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.",0
"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused.",1
"Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!",2
"Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!",2
"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.",1
"Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause--",2
What the..?,0
"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss!",2
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!,2
"No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!",1
"Oh, dude, this is not cool!",2
"Relax, fatass.",1
"No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.",2
"Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!",2
Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny!,2
"* I told you, fatass.",0
"Whoa, cool.",2
Totally!,2
"Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.",2
Sshh!,0
"You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!",1
Oh. We don't know him.,2
Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one?,2
We don't know.,0
K-kill me.,2
"No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.",2
Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.,2
"God job, fatass!",1
"Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.",2
Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.,0
"Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.",0
"Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this?",2
"Oh, my God, this guy again.",2
Why would anybody send this asshole money?,1
Yeh-hah.,1
"Oh! Aww!  Oh, weak!",2
Starvin' Marvin!,1
He did take a ship.,1
"Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!",2
"Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.",0
I think he wants us to get in.,1
"Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!",0
Let's go somewhere.,1
This is great!,0
"Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off?",2
"Yeah, that's better.",0
"No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.",1
"No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.",2
"Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world.",0
"Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this?",2
"What the hell did you hit, Cartman?!",0
"Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?!",1
Where are we?,1
"We're on like, some foreign planet.",0
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.,1
"Uh, thanks.",0
"U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.",0
Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!,2
"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!",0
"Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true!",2
Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.,1
"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.",1
"Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.",0
Uuh. Thanks.,0
"Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.",0
"Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there.",1
"No, never. It's perfect.",2
"Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!",1
"Oh, no, dude!",1
"I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!",1
Run for it!,0
"Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!",2
Watch out! Here I come!,1
Forget him! He's done for!,2
"He's not done for, he's standing right there.",0
"No, no, he's done for. Come on!",2
"Alright, we made it!",0
"Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!",1
What was that?,1
They're shooting at us.,0
"Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.",1
"Well, how'd we do it last time??",1
"Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.",0
"Which button did you press, Cartman??",1
U-u-huh. I don't remember.,2
You don't remember?!,1
"You dumbass, Cartman!",0
"Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one.",2
Holy shit!,2
"You got 'em, Marvin.",0
"Yeah, now finish 'em off!",1
Where did that come from??,1
It's Sally Struthers!,2
"Sorry, Marvin. We tried.",1
Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!,2
"Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now.",2
"Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you.",2
She bought it.,2
Sally Struthers is saving us!,0
Now's our chance!,0
Wait. I remember. It was the red button!,2
It's pulling us in!,1
Marvin...,1
"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.",0
"Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.",1
"Wow! Good job, dude!",0
"Alright,",2
"Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.",0
"No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.",1
Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.,0
"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.",2
What? We're not gonna come visit him.,2
"I know, but you don't tell him that!",0
"T'heh, whatever.",2
"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt.",0
Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?,2
"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.",1
"That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—",2
Christmas?,0
—Christmastime is presents for me.,2
"Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys.",2
"Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.",1
"Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...",2
Cool!,2
Ewww-hoohooo.,2
"Oh-HO, grohoss.",2
"Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!",2
"Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck.",1
W-we weren't scared!,0
The what?,1
Nuh-uh.,1
That's just an old legend.,0
"You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it.",2
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!,0
Yeah! Let's see how they like it!,1
"Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.",0
"We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.",2
"That's not scary, fatass!",1
"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts!",0
"Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...",2
"Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?",2
That's only 72 shopping days left for you!,2
"Come on, fatass, we have to go!",0
"Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.",2
I can't go with you guys right now.,2
"Yes you can, porky.",0
"Mom, seriously!",2
"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then.",1
"God-damnit, mom!",2
"God, I hate you guys!",2
"Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.",0
What's the scariest thing we could get?,0
Spooky spider?,2
No!  A dead body.,0
"Yeah, fatass, a dead body.",1
"You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?",2
"We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.",0
"Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!",1
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?,2
We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.,0
"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??",1
"Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?",0
Are you insane?!,1
U-hi think that's a sweet idea!,2
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.,1
"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,",0
"Naww, let's dig up somebody else.",1
"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.",0
This is gonna be fun!,2
"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.",2
"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!",0
"This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma.",1
"Well, let's dig 'er up!",0
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.,1
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!,0
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.,1
"""Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!""  Ow.",2
"You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!",0
"I don't really care, dude.",1
"Yes you do! Now, dig!",0
"Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""You-hoo""...",2
"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.",0
"Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.",1
"Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?",2
"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!",1
"Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.",0
"Heh heh, I'm sweet.",2
"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!",1
"Okay, grab the sled.",0
"Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...",2
"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.",0
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?,1
"We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!""",2
"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!",1
Who was that?,0
Cartman?!,1
It wasn't me!,2
"Dude, not cool. This is scary.",0
"Hay, you're that band KoRn.",0
What are you guys doing out here?,0
"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.",0
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.,1
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.,0
"Yeah, dude. It's right over there.",0
"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes.",0
Shouldn't we hide her better than that?,1
"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!",0
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!,1
"Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!",2
"A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!",2
"I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got!",2
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.,0
Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.,2
"Where's your costume, fatass?",0
"Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!""",2
"Hey, Kenny.",0
"U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!",2
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet,0
"Uuh, problem, guys.",2
What's the problem?,0
Nno Grandma.,2
No Grandma??,1
She's not here!,1
She has to be here!,0
"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!",1
"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!",1
Somebody took my dead grandma.,1
"We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.",0
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.,1
"Then, you'll help us?",1
Right.,1
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.,0
How should we split up?,0
Wow! That was easy.,1
This place gives me the creeps.,0
Whoa. What was that?,1
"Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.",2
How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?,2
"Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!",2
We've got to hide!,0
That didn't help at all.,2
Yeah! Where's Grandma?,1
There she is!,0
"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back!",0
Boo!,0
"Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here!",2
"A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!",2
"Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.",2
"What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?""",2
"C, H. ""Ch."" Chalk.",2
"T, H. ""Th."" There. Hey, this is easy!  I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!",2
"You're going down, bitch!",2
"Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.",1
"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon!",2
Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?,2
"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?",1
"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before.",0
What?! What the fuck that that mean?,2
"Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum!  Come on!",2
Uuh. Definition?,2
Country of origin?,2
Could you please use it in a sentence?,2
"Uh- chair. C H A R E  God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?!  Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!",2
Wow!,1
Definition?,1
"Uh, could you use it in a sentence?",1
"""Krocsyldiphic.""",1
"""Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!",1
"Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.",0
Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth.,2
What's your name?,1
Wooww.,1
"Oh, yes. We must do it again.",2
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?,0
How come you don't go to school?,2
You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?,2
"Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?",2
"Shut up, Cartman?",0
"You shut up,  butthole.",2
"You shut up,  gaywad!",0
"You shut up,  ass-logger!",2
"No, we're friends.",0
"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.",0
"Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?",1
"...Uuh, can I talk to her?",1
"U-u-uh, hi.",1
"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all.",1
"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?",2
Ey! How come you never pick me?!,2
"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!",2
"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.",0
That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!,2
"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.",0
"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled!",2
"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me.""",0
"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you.",0
All right.,0
"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.",0
"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own.",0
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.,1
"Aw, man, if you have to.",0
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!,1
"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now.",0
"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.",0
"Ah, dude, you don't say that.",0
"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.",1
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.,0
Eeehhh.,2
"Eehh, shut up.  Ooohhh, yeasss.",2
"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.",2
Could you turn up the heat just a little?,2
"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules.  Yeeehhhhhhss!",2
"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,",1
"Uuuh, okay.  Gah!",1
"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.",1
"No no. I mean, go with me.",1
"Ahhhhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.",2
"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom.",2
"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey.",2
"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?",0
"Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.",2
"Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!",0
"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.",2
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.,0
That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.,2
"No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey!",2
"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!",0
"You're damn straight, he did.",2
You got my note?,1
"Uh, can we sit down?",1
"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?",1
"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.",1
"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study",1
"Love, for one thing.",1
"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.",1
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.,1
"Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.",1
I'm not completely sure.,1
"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right.",1
Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?,1
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.,0
"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!",0
"Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help?",0
I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.,1
"Oh, brother!",0
"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!",1
"You suck now, Kyle!",0
You suck!,1
Rebecca. You...,1
Uh. All I did was show her how to-,1
Ooww!,1
"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!",0
"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark.",0
"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark?",0
"Nice speech, nerdo.",0
Now you're gettin' it.,2
Ready? 1-2-3-4.,0
"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?",1
I'm playing the drum.,2
"Well, you have to hit it softer!",1
"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.",2
"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!",1
I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!,2
"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!",0
"Ey, I'll get it!",2
"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!",1
Yes I will!,2
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.,0
"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!",2
Cartman!!!,1
"Give me the drum, and you play the flute.",1
No way! Flutes are totally gay!,2
"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!",0
"Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home!",2
You dick!,1
Later.,2
"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment.",0
He'll show.,1
He'd better!,0
"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?",1
"Dude, that's not cool.",0
"Good morning, gentlemen.",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?",0
Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.,1
"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.",2
"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!",0
"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.",2
"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!",1
"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.",2
"No they're not, stupid!",1
Yes we are!,2
How much do you wanna bet?!,1
"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!",1
"Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.",2
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??,1
You're on!,1
"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield.",2
Hoohoo what a dumbass!,0
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.,1
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.,0
Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!,2
Hooray for the South!,2
"Cartman, you can't do that!",0
But why? Why should they get the bell?,2
But we don't have to lose.,2
"Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!""",2
What do we do?!,1
"Run for your life, dude!",0
God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!,2
"So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?",2
"You cheated, Cartman!",1
"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!",0
"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!",1
I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot.,2
Perhaps we should take Topeka.,2
"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.",2
No. I say we take Topeka.,2
I'll bet you can't.,2
"I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!",2
"Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.",2
"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.",1
"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.",2
Excuse meh.,2
"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.",0
"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?",1
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?,0
What battlefield?!,0
"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee",2
"God damnit, that fat piece of shit!",0
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??,1
That would suck so much ass.,0
"We have to stop him, dude.",1
"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?",0
We'll give you 10 bucks.,1
"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.",0
"Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.",0
"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!",1
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.,0
"Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.",2
"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.",0
"Where did the Confederates go, son?",2
"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.",2
Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.,2
"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.",0
Where are you going?,2
"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!",2
No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!,2
"Haha! You lose, fatass!",0
"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-",1
"This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot!",2
"Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.",2
"Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.",2
"Oh, no.",0
We'll never stop them now.,1
Yes! Yes!,2
Take the fort!,2
"Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.",0
Suck my ass!,2
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.,2
"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.",0
I knew they would!,2
"Aw, damnit!",0
Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!,2
"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.",2
"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.",0
"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?",0
I don't. I made it up.,2
"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.",1
"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.",0
"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.",0
"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.",1
No! We still have to fight!,2
NOOO!!,2
"It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!",0
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off!,1
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!,2
Don't touch me.,0
"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!",1
"Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!",2
"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-",0
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.,2
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!,2
Awwww!,0
Hahahaha haa ha!,2
"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!",0
"Yeah. Thanks, dick!",1
"Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.",1
"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!",2
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?,1
"Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.",2
"Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!",1
"Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.",2
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,",1
Jews...,2
I made you out of clay.,1
...play stupid games.,2
with dreidel I shall play.,1
that's why they're lame.,2
"What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.",0
It's sooo amazing!  You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!,2
"Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.",0
"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.",1
I'll try to make it spin.,0
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.",1
It fell; I'll try again.,0
"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,",1
I'll try,0
Jews..,2
to make it spin.,0
It fell;,0
I'll try again.,0
"Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,",1
"Hi, Mom!",1
"Yes, we know, Ms. Broflovski. It's so very interesting.",2
that's why they're lame.,2
"Oh, hi Dad.",1
"Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!",1
Jews…,2
Dad?,1
Dad.,1
We're singing about a dreidel.,1
"And...

"Time to go, Mr. Hankey.",2
"Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.",1
"Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.",0
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!,1
You guys! You guys!  Guess what?,2
"What, fatass?!",1
"I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys!",2
No you didn't!,0
Yes! I really did.,2
"Well, because yesterday I got my period.",2
You got your what?,1
"My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.",2
"You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?",0
"Please, it's important.",0
"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right!",1
"Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't.",2
"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.",0
"Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.",1
"Dude, did you get your period yet?",1
"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.",0
"Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.",1
"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.",0
"Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.",0
"Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!",2
You did?,2
"You got your period too, Kenny?",1
"Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.",2
"Ike, can I talk to you?",1
"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!",1
"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.",1
"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.",1
"Thanks a lot, Ike!",1
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?,0
"Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?",2
Tampon? What's a tampon?,2
"Ew, doesn't that hurt?",2
"You guys! I got my period, too!",1
You did?,0
"Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.",1
"All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.",2
Awesome! We get powers?,1
"Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others.",2
"Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan",0
Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!,0
I'm not bleeding out my aahass!,0
"No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.",0
"Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?",2
Here.,1
Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!,2
"And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.",2
"I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.",1
"Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.",2
Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.,1
"What's the matter, Kyle?",2
"Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.",1
"...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.",2
Phew.,1
Can I come in?,0
"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.",0
"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.",0
"Yeah, Cartman told us.",0
"...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.",0
"But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it!",0
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.,0
"Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.",0
"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.",0
So do you know anything that can help him?,0
Hormones?,0
"Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best!",0
"Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us.",2
"Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh-",1
Hey assholes!,0
"Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.",2
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!,0
Hormones?,1
"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!",0
"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.",1
"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.",2
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?,0
"Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.",2
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones.,0
"Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-",2
"Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-",2
"Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!",2
"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.",0
"Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people.",2
"Hey, here comes Stan.",1
Have I missed anything?,0
"Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.",2
"Did you get your period yet, Stan?",1
"No. I didn't, but-",0
"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas.",2
"Jesus, why does God hate me?",0
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.,0
"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?",0
I just wanted my period.,0
I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?!,0
How do know that?,1
"Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...",0
Let's have a cup o-Aaaa!,0
"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.",2
"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh.",2
What's Arkansas—is that a state?,0
That was pretty cool.,2
"Okay, how about this one, Kenny?",2
No? How about this?,2
"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this?",2
"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.",2
"What's ""lose bowel control?""",0
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.,2
"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!",1
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!,2
"How about this one, Kenny?",2
"There is no brown noise, fat boy!",1
That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.,2
Who's Karen Carpenter?,0
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting.,0
Who the hell are these guys?,1
We're not rednecks!,0
"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!",1
"Stan, what's a queef?",2
"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!",2
Aaaa-,2
Why?! Don't you know?!,0
"Alright, dickhole!",1
"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere!",1
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!,0
"Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.",1
Damnit!,0
"Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!",2
What's it mean?! What's it mean?!,1
"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise.""",2
Awwgh!,1
"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!",0
"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?",2
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading!,0
"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.",0
"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.",1
"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.",0
Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!,1
What word could we make up?,0
How about... finkleroy?,1
"No, uhno, not finkleroy.",0
"How about geebo, or, or mung?",2
"Yeah, mung.",0
Mung's good.,1
Sh. Here they come.,0
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?,0
"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?",1
We busted you!,0
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up!,1
Eewww.,1
Ooogh.,0
"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!",1
"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.",2
What the hell is that lady talking about?,1
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.,0
Yeah. They think they're so cool.,1
"You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!",2
"Calm down, Cartman.",1
You found what?,0
"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?",2
I don't believe it!,1
"Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay.",2
That's amazing.,1
I told you guys!,2
"Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?",0
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.,2
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.,0
Ooooh.,2
"They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.",2
"How do we write he note, Cartman?",0
"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this.",2
"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.",0
"Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.",2
"Okay, let's get back to the room.",0
"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.",0
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!,1
This is gonna be sweet!,1
"Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed!",0
Uh-oh.,2
"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-",1
Stop! Stop!,0
"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means.",0
"Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.",0
Uuuuh...,0
"Oh, no!",1
"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?",2
We win again!,0
"Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!",2
Sleds are for guys.,0
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!,2
"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.",0
Oh yeah?!,1
We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!,2
You got it!,0
Noo problem!,0
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!,1
"Oh, boy! We'll show them!",0
"Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock!",2
Fatass.,1
There!,2
Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.,2
"I'm sorry, Mom.",2
"I'm sorry, Token.",2
"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.",2
...What the hell is a hate crime?,2
What? A federal offense?,2
Oh no??,2
"Uh, yes?",2
He's a black kid that goes to my school?,2
He is black.,2
I did?,2
No! I hate hippies!,2
"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!",2
"Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!",2
"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.",0
"Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!",2
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!,2
"Calm down, Kenny!",2
Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!,2
"Well, come on! I don't have much time!",2
"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!",2
What the hell are they doing?,1
"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?",0
"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon.",1
"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit!",2
Son of a bitch!,0
Huh-who's Romper Stomper?,2
"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.",0
"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman.",1
"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?",0
"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.",1
"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.",0
"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!",1
"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go!",0
"Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.",1
"Nice going, fat boy!",0
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.,2
"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?",2
"Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?",2
"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.",2
"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!",0
"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!",1
"Come on, let's get it a try.",0
Yeah-,0
"Dude, bail! Bail!",0
"Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.",0
We killed Kenny?,1
We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.,0
"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?",1
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.,0
"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.",0
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.,1
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!,0
How?,1
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.,0
Sweet! Let's go!,1
"Hey, fatass. How's prison?",1
"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?",2
"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!",0
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.,1
A what?,2
An ailnay ilefay.,1
Wwhat's that?,2
"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!",1
"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!",0
"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here",2
"They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!",1
"Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?",2
"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-",1
Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!,2
Sshh!,0
"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.",2
How are we supposed to give them to you?,0
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.,2
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.,0
"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!",2
"Alright, here.",0
"Well, okay... here... l'see...",2
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.,0
"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now.",2
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals.,1
"Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah.",2
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file.,0
So now what do we do?,1
"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!",0
Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.,2
"Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  One.  Heh, two.  Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh  yeahhh. Hoh. Phew.  Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit!",2
"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.",2
Son of a bitch!,2
"Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.",1
"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.",0
Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?,1
Hi. Can Token come out and play?,0
Killer.,1
"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?",0
"Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!",1
It's not?,0
"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.",1
"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?",0
"Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!",2
"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!",2
But you said-,2
I thought that-,2
I want my Mo-omm,2
"Mommy, I want my Mommy!",2
You will?,2
"Okay, go ahead and start.",0
"I don't start, you start.",1
"Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.",0
"And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?",1
"If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?",0
"Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.",0
"But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.",1
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...,0
What's the matter?,2
Uhokay.,2
Oh. Really?,2
Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.,2
Oh. I can't take these.,2
Romper?,2
"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.",2
"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!",2
"O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes.",2
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.,0
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.,1
"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.",1
"Alright, where's Clyde.",0
"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!",0
"On the sled, fatass!",1
You guys!,2
It's Cartman!,0
That's right! I'm back!,2
What the hell's wrong with Clyde?,2
All right! Let's do this!,0
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.,2
"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.",2
"Go, fatass!",1
"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-",2
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them!,0
Oh no! The girls are gonna win!,1
We're not gonna make it!,0
Hey.,2
We won! We won!,1
"It's good to have you back, Cartman.",1
"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.",0
"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.",2
Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?,2
"Hey, Romper Stomper.",2
"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.",2
You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?,2
Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.,2
Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-,2
"Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh!",2
Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!,2
"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!",2
Yeah! This is so tits!,2
"Oh, I mean, this is so cool!",2
"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard!",2
"Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!",2
"Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!",2
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!,0
He's fat and he's stupid?,1
Look what the tooth fairy left me last night!,2
Two dollars!,0
For one tooth?,0
For one tooth.,2
"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.",0
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.,1
"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.",2
...Totally what?,1
"Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.",2
All we need is teeth.,2
I already lost all my baby teeth.,0
Me too.,1
"You still have baby teeth, Kenny?",1
"Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?",2
"Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!",2
"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?",0
"Almost. You ready, Timmy?",1
"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?",1
Right. You're Timmy.,1
"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.",2
"Alright! Get ready, Timmy.",1
"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.",0
"Uh, Butters, could we have it?",0
"Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.",1
"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.",0
How are we gonna get it from him?,2
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.,0
"Yeah, let's go.",1
"No, Timmy, wait!",1
"Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.",2
"Higher, you guys.",2
"Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?",0
"Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down.",2
"I am the tooth fairy, my child.",2
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow.,2
"Come on, fatass!",1
Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.,2
Bull's eye!,2
"I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.",2
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.,2
"I know, huh?",2
"You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-",2
Did the tooth fairy come?,1
Four dollars.,2
Four dollars?,1
Do you what this means?,2
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow.,0
Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!,2
"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!",2
"You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?",2
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?,2
"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?",2
"How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.",2
"No, Mother! No more lies!",2
"Dude, where's the money?",0
There is no money.,2
No more money??,1
"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!",0
I know!,2
"Cartman, what's going on?!",1
"You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.",2
Tell us what?!,0
"You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it.",2
"What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?""",1
"My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.",2
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.,1
"But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny.",2
"You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!",1
"Kyle, open your eyes, man!",2
It's not true!,1
"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?",1
Oh my God! You did lie to me.,1
"Peter Pan, too??",1
What about Moses and Abraham?,1
Probably?! Is Atlantis real??,1
Wahahahah!,1
"Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!",1
"Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.",2
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?,1
"No, man, that's just a TV show.",2
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!,0
"What? That your parents lied to you, too?",2
"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!",0
"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?",0
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.,1
"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!",0
The kid will never even know.,0
"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!",2
"Oh my God, what if I'm not real?",1
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!,0
"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?",1
"Come on, Kyle!",0
What if this is all just somebody's dream?,1
"Wow, look at the size of these houses!",2
"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""",0
"Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there.",2
"There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.",0
Got it.,2
This is the smartest business venture ever.,0
What the-?,2
"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!",0
"...Hey, you can't do that!",0
Because that's what we're doing!,0
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!,2
Two years?,1
It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!,2
You scram! We were here first!,0
You woke him up!,0
Who's the Boss?,0
"Uuh, yeah.",0
We were there first!,2
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!,0
"Well, uh-what do you mean?",0
"What's a ""tooth trade?""",0
Amazing.,0
"Man, that is tits!",2
Oh. Uh-I don't know.,0
"Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...",2
How much do we get if we work for you?,0
"Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-",2
We're in!,0
We all want double-desserts today!,0
"Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang.",2
"That's right. Keep the change, my man.",2
"U-uh, Chef.",0
CHEF!,0
We're not dealing drugs!,0
"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!",0
"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?",2
"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.",0
"Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!",2
"Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.",1
"Sure, Kyle.",2
"So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.",2
"Can I ask you a question, Weasel?",2
Do you think I'm an idiot?,2
"These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!",2
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you!,2
"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.",1
"Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!",2
"Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?",1
Will somebody take those books away from him?,2
"Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.",2
"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!",1
"Dude, just stop thinking about it.",0
"But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together?",1
"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.",1
"Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!",2
"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening!",1
"Aw, shit.",0
I got it!,2
"I am nothing, and everything.",1
Hunh. That was pretty weird.,1
"Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.",2
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?,0
"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.",1
...Tits.,2
"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns",0
Awwww!,1
"Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.",0
"He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow.",2
"Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides!",2
"Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.",2
How long does this thing last?,1
Two hours.,0
Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers?,2
Whoa.,1
"Damn, dude.",0
Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.,1
"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!",1
Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on!,2
"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?",0
"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.",2
"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.",1
"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over.",0
Let's go practice.,1
"Dude, this isn't working.",0
It's Kenny's singing!,1
"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!",2
"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again!",0
"I'm tired, Grandpa.",0
I don't know.  Whoa.,0
"Hurry up, you guys!",0
What's going on?,2
"Dude, you're not gonna believe this.",0
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!,2
Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.,0
"What's a ""quin-tuplet""?",1
But there's only four of you.,1
"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?",1
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?,0
"Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.",0
"But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!",2
"Okay, hold it, hold it.",0
"You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.",2
How can you say that?,1
"Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!",2
"Oh, yeah!",1
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?,0
They have nowhere else to go.  Please?,0
That's your dad?,0
"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.",1
"Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??",0
"You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.",1
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.,2
"Damn, we might be screwed.",2
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!,0
"You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!",2
And shopping malls! Hooray!,2
"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!",0
Alright!,1
"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.",0
"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??",1
Now what do we do?,0
"Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!",0
"Dude, what the hell happened?",2
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.,0
"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!",1
"Yeah! Well, not this time!",0
"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!",0
"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.",0
Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!,0
"Come on, angry mob!",0
Take that!,2
"Yeah, you suck, dude!",2
"Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!",2
"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.",0
"Yeah, screw them!",2
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.,1
Whatever happened to Kenny?,0
"Dude, did you do all your homework last night?",0
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.,1
I know!,0
"Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.",2
Phew!,2
"Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-",2
"Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!",2
The Declaration of Independence?,1
"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.",0
But he is-,0
He doesn't have to do homework?,0
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.,1
"Yeah, me too.",2
I've got ADD.,0
Hoo-ray.,2
...I am eight.,1
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.,2
"Dude, it's Timmy.",0
No way!,1
That was awesuhome!,2
"Yeah, Timmy ruhules!",0
But he's funny.,0
He looks pretty happy to me.,0
"Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?",1
"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.",0
"Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?",2
"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.",0
"No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.",2
Because we're on Ritalin.,0
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.,1
"It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it.",2
"That's correct, Chef.",1
"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium",1
Oh boy oh boy.,0
"But there are no side effects, Chef.",0
"No, not at all.",1
Did you guys see that?,2
See what?,0
"What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?",2
"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin?",1
There you go.,2
Whah!,2
Let's watch something else.,0
"Yes, let's.",1
Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?,0
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.,1
"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.",0
"I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.",2
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.,1
Sounds good.,0
"So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny.",2
"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.",0
Bastard.,1
"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?",0
"Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.",1
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.,1
"Come, see him with us.",1
"Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  She's on my back! Hah!",2
"Sure was, Dad.",0
"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice.",0
You'll be inside of me...,2
Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.,2
I feel... different.,0
"Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh",2
Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!,0
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!,1
"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!",0
"No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!",0
Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!,1
"Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.",2
"Dude, I don't understand this game at all.",0
"It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.",2
"Um, deny it?",0
"Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says.",2
"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.",1
"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS!",2
I just gave you AIDS.,2
AIDS?!,1
"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.",0
"Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points.",2
"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.",2
"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!",0
"...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!",2
"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .",2
"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!",1
"Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME.",2
"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys""  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  ""So what are you into?""  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  ""Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?""  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!",2
"Hi, are you Tony?",2
"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.",2
"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks.",2
What the hell just happened?,2
"Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?",2
Mister Hammerhead?,2
Mr. Garrison??,2
You wanna be my friend?,2
"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?",2
"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!",2
"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.",1
"Oh, man, that's terrible.",0
"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah!",1
"Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.",0
Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.,1
Blaaa-lalalalalalala.,0
"Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!",2
We're making faces at sick people.,0
"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?!",2
We don't know.,0
"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!",2
"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.",1
"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!",2
"You're not more mature than us, Cartman!",0
YES I AM!!,2
"Dr. Mephesto, I need help.",2
"You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.",2
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!,2
NAMBLA?,2
"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!",2
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?,2
Sure.,2
...Sweet.,2
"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.",1
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?,0
Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!,2
"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!",2
"Thanks, dude.",2
Really? Awesome!,2
"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.",2
KIIICK ASS!,2
"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.",2
"We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!",2
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!,0
"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.",2
We don't wanna go!,1
You can't go.,2
We don't WANNA go!,1
"No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out",2
"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.",0
"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.",1
"What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!",2
"We got invited too, fatass!",0
"Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.",2
Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.,2
This is boring.,0
"Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?",1
That seems kind of... weird.,0
Dude. Being mature is boring!,1
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!,0
"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here!",1
"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide!",0
Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.,1
They're all over the place.,2
"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.",0
"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.",2
"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters.",2
"Now, are you a team player or not?!",2
"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team.""",2
"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.",2
"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.",2
Dude. You have sex with children.,1
"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.",0
Seriously.,1
"Well, Cartman",1
"Well, what?",2
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?,1
"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.",2
"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?",0
"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long.",2
"Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.",2
Here!,0
"Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.",2
"Dude, what the hell was that?",0
"Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!",2
"...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.",0
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.,0
"Not with me, man.",2
He's fakin'!,0
He's fakin'!,2
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.,2
"Now, that's a get-well card!",0
"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?",0
"Go on, Butters!",0
"Butters, go on!",0
"Dude, you really are sick, huh?",0
"I don't know, I...",1
"Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?",0
"Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?",0
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.,0
Don't be a smartass?,0
"Hi, doctor.",0
"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.",0
But I don't think it's working.,0
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.,0
"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.",0
"Who?  Oh, shit.",0
"""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.",2
"Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.",2
"No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow!",2
"Okay, mom.",2
"What's goin' on, guys?",2
"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.",0
Oh-kay.,2
"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.",0
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.,0
"Oh, I think I see where this is going.",2
"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.",0
"Stan, why don't you just ask the question?",2
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?,0
"No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!",2
"But you only need one, fat boy!",0
"No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!",2
"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!",0
"Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.",2
How much?,1
"I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?",2
"Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!",0
"Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.",2
"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!",0
"What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.",2
"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here.",0
"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!",2
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?,0
"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.",0
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?,0
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?,0
"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.",0
"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.",0
"I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live!",0
"Come on, where are they?",0
This is it??,0
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??,0
"Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!",0
We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.,0
No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!,2
"Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.",0
Sshhh!,0
"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?",0
"Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!",0
"Shut up, Fluffy!",2
"Oh, phew.",0
"Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!",2
"Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...",0
"...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!",0
"whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!",2
"You suck, Cartman!",0
"Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!",2
"God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!",0
I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care.,2
"There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!",0
"My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend...",0
Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!,0
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?,0
"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.",0
"Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!",2
"Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!",2
"Dude, please. Kyle needs it.",0
"It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!",2
"Alright, alright, here.",0
"Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.",2
"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.",2
"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!",2
"Better, thanks.",1
You look a lot better.,0
"Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.",1
"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.",0
"Heh. Hey, what what's going on?",2
"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!",0
"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.",0
Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!,2
"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?",0
Oh. ...Thanks?,1
I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!,2
"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches.",0
Huh?  What the?,1
"Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.",2
Thaaat's ri-ight.,2
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!,1
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!,2
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!,0
Yes I do!,2
"Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!",2
Told ya.,1
"Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.",0
"Yeah, we got it.",1
"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag.",0
"Yeah, me neither.",1
Islam??,0
"Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.",0
Not really.,1
"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.",0
"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.",0
"It's okay, I'm here.",2
"Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.",2
"That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.",2
"The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.",2
Mmmm.,2
"You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?",2
"Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?",2
"Whoa! Calm down, ho.",2
"I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!",2
Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!,2
You won't let me help.,2
"…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.",2
"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them?",1
"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!",0
"Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!",1
"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.",1
"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.",0
"Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.",1
"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there.",1
"Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints.",0
"Pretty good, I guess.",1
Do you think they should change the flag?,0
"Kenny ate all the mints, dad.",1
That was a good one.,0
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?,2
"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.",2
"Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs.""",2
Me neither.,2
Huh.,2
Whoa.,2
"Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.",2
Ahh!,2
"Okay, It will be like this forever.",2
"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing.",1
W-we really didn't see it that way.,1
"Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.",1
"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?",1
"Wait, I don't get it.",0
"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.",1
"Me, too!",2
"Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.",2
"Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.",2
"And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl",2
My... girrrrrrrl...,2
"Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it!",2
"Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.",2
...How?,1
Boy band.,2
Boy band?,0
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!,1
"There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!",2
"Dude, we don't have any musical talent.",0
"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!",2
"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--",2
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.,1
"So, all boy bands have five members.",1
"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.",1
"Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!",2
"Well, I guess.",0
"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall.",0
"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.",0
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.,0
"Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.",2
"We'll let you know, Butters.",2
"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!",2
It was?,1
"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.",0
"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!",2
"Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.",0
Kyle's brother?,2
I promised my mom I'd let him try.,1
Christ's sake..!,2
Next!,2
Next audition!,2
"Goddammit, NEXT!",2
"Not the next song, the next PERSON!  Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day.",2
"Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band!",2
"Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.",0
"Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!",1
"Okayokay, fine. Wow me.",2
"Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh.",2
"Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!",1
"Dude, she's a chick!",2
"Come on, nobody's gonna notice.",0
"""Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?!",2
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.,0
"Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!",2
Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?,2
"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?",0
"We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!",2
Costumes?,0
"Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters...",2
"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?",0
"'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.",2
I wanna be the tough one.,1
"...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--",2
I wanna be the tough one!,1
"You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!",2
Jews are tough!,1
Since when?!,2
"Since Abraham, fatass!",1
"Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this!",2
"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?",0
"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.",2
Kenny says that's not what it means.,0
"Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?",2
"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!",2
"Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!",2
We're goin' to see the mall manager.,2
"Uh oh, mall cops.",0
"But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..!",2
"Oh, God, I can't see!",2
"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.",0
The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on!,2
Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up.,2
"Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!",2
We... are Fingerbang!,2
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.,2
"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?",2
"Alright! Let's do it, boys!",2
"And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--",2
"--you're my fantasy, you fanta--",2
"Well, so can we play here?",2
No??,2
Why not?!,2
"You don't think we're any good, do you?!",2
"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best.",2
Wow. I feel so rejected.,1
Uh-oh.,0
Run for it!,1
"Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.",2
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me.,2
"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know?",2
What's the Gomlich effect?,2
So how do boy bands use that?,2
Thanks!,2
Cucumber in the pants. Got it.,2
"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?",2
"I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera.",2
"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?",1
"Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck.",2
"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!",2
"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!",2
Fine! Who would you go crazy for?,2
"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.",2
Roll camera!,2
"Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!",2
"Oh uh, Kyle has it.",2
We are making a music video.,0
"Dad, I was just a--",0
"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?",0
"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.",0
"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine.",2
Hello again!,2
I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.,2
"If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed!",2
"Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool.",2
You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.,2
Really? You will?,2
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?,2
"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed!",2
"Aw, Mom!",2
"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?",0
"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.",0
"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--",0
Dad? What the hell is going on?,0
Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.,0
...Oh-kay.,0
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there.,1
Where the hell is Stan?!,2
He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.,1
"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!",2
"Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.",2
Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.,2
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!,1
"Oh, god-damnit!",2
"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.",0
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.,0
Alright!,0
God damnit! People are walking away!,2
Just another minute.,2
"Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.",2
It's Stan!,1
"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!",2
"Dude, where the hell have you been?!",1
"Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?",2
"We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.""  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...",2
No! He can't be dead!,2
"Dude, he's pretty dead.",1
No! We were so close!,2
But we have to perform!,2
"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!",1
"Oh, yes we do.",0
"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!",2
"Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!",2
We made two dollars.,1
"You were great, Dad.",0
"Ok-Okay, okay.",2
"Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.",2
"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!""",2
...Yeah. That's gonna suck.,1
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.,0
I don't think they sell those anymore.,0
"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million?",1
"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah.",2

"No no, no. Separation.",2

Ugh!,2
"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.",0
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn!,0
"Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom.",2
Are we gonna go to hell?,0
"A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?",2
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.,0
"Yeah, what if we haven't?",2
Jesus was made of crackers?,2
But crackers are his- body.,0
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.,2
"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.",0
No??,0
"Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly!",2
Nno!,2
"But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?",2
Confession?,0
"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.",0
"Oh yeah, okay.",2
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.,0
"Right, I already got that one.",2
"Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?",1
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.,0
Uhwuwhat?,1
Have you confessed all your sins yet?,0
No-o-o-o-o!,1
"Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.",2
Oh good. I don't?,1
"No, you're already going to hell.",2
I am not!,1
"You are, too!",2
"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.",0
I'm gonna go ask my mom!,1
"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?",0
Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.,2
"What, Butters?",0
What'd we do to Timmy?,2
"Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.",2
"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.",0
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.,0
"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-",0
How was it?,2
"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!",0
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.,0
Who's in there?,2
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.,0
"Well, here goes everything.",2
"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.",2
"Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...",2
"...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-",0
God damnit!,0
"Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?",0
We have a question.,0
Where do handicapped people go when they die?,0
"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?",0
"And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?",2
"Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.",2
"No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it.",2
"Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!",2
Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.,2
What happened??,0
"I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.",2
Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?,1
"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.",1
We don't? But what if we're wrong?,1
"Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.",1
"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!",1
I don't think so.,0
Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.,1
"Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?",1
Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.,1
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on.,0
"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.",0
Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!,2
HAAAAH!,1
Turn around so I can clean out your ass.,2
"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!",0
"Oh, now you've said it, too!",2
"Oh, shit!  Oh!",0
"Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.",2
But what about them?,0
"Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel!",2
"Okay, come on.",0
Come on! This stupid light won't change.,0
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.,0
"Uh, come on, let's go.",0
"...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!",0
And he never took Communion!,2
He's doomed.,0
"Come on, hurry up!",2
Oh no! It's locked!,0
What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!,2
Confession box is over there!,0
"I'm first, I'm first!",2
What the?,2
You're a sinner!,0
You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!,2
"Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!",2
"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?",0
"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!",2
"We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-",2
Pamphlet. Pamphlet.,0
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!,2
"It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!",2
But what if we're wrong?,1
Let's go.,0
...they've killed Kenny!,0
"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!",2
"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh!",2
"Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.",0
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.,0
"Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.",1
"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?",2
Praise God-uh!,2
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.,2
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.,0
"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!",1
"Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!",1
"Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants.",2
"Wow, cool.",0
"No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!",2
"This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!",2
"Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?",2
Oh my God!!,2
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!,2
Kenny?!  What's he say?,0
Ask him what hell is like.,1
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!,2
"Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.",2
"He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!",2
"And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!",2
"We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh!",2
"Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!",2
"The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!",2
"Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.",2
"Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting.",2
"Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon.",2
"Sister, have you read this book?",2
Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.,2
Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?,2
"We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus!",2
Well...,2
"Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?",2
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!,2
"That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!",2
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?,2
"Uh, I think so.",1
Praise the Lord-uh!,2
"For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!",2
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!,2
Devil be  gone-uh!,2
"Now walk, Timmih!",2
"Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!",2
"The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih!",2
He walks-uh!,2
Yes! Praise the Lord!,2
"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy?",2
And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?,2
"Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone!",2
"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!",2
He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!,2
"Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!""",2
"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now!",2
"Dude, that seems kind of... weird.",0
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.,1
"Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!",2
What worked?,0
Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!,2
You're keeping that money yourself?,1
"Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.",2
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?,0
"It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.",2
"Well, what about going to hell and all that?!",0
"Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.",2
Then why didn't you tell us?!,1
"My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!",2
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!,1
"Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.",0
Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh!,2
Sister Anne is a blasphemer!,2
Uh-oh.,2
"Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.",2
"Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!",2
"No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!",2
"Serves you right, Cartman!",1
You're gonna send me to hell?,2
"Aw, crap!",2
"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.",0
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders!,1
"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!",1
"Ungh, gay, dude.",1
"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here",0
What grade are you going into?,0
Stupid third grader!,0
"Yeah,  get out of here!",2
"There, that's better.",2
"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.",1
Denver?,0
"U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her.",2
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship!,1
"Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical!",0
"Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!",0
"Why, that's PERfect!",2
"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.",0
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.,1
"Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!""",0
Together we are strong!,1
"We got you covered, Timmy.",0
"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?",1
"Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?",2
"Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.",0
"Holy God, dude!",1
"...More like, Ms. Makesmesick.",0
"KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.",2
"Oh, I'm sure I do.",2
I'm trying.,2
"Fantastic, then.",2
What a bitch!,0
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.,1
You guys are all such pussies!,2
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.,0
I just didn't think it would come so soon.,1
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.,2
"Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade",2
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.,1
I wish I was still there.,2
"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!",0
We travel back in time.,0
"Oh yeah, time travel.",1
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.,0
"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.",2
"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.",1
"Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!",2
"Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.",2
"We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.",0
So can you do it?,1
Back in the third grade.,0
"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!",1
Oh! Here she comes.,0
"Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-",2
"We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!",2
"Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen?",2
"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa!",2
You're damn right they do!,2
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!,1
Come on!,1
"Timmy, you have to stop!",0
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!,1
No??,1
"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?",0
My God!,0
"Over here, over here!",0
Less than 20 minutes?!,0
Oh no! What have we done?!,1
"Well, who didn't see that coming?",0
"...nine, eight...",0
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!,0
"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!",1
W-what did you get in a fight about?,0
"Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!",0
"Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?",2
"Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!",0
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!,1
"God-damnit, this is ridiculous.",0
"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?",0
Who the hell cares?!,2
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?,1
"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!",1
"God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!",2
Wait a minute! I've got it.,0
"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!",0
"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.",2
"Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen?",2
"Oh, son of a bitch!",0
"There it is! Come on, everybody!",2
"No way, lady!",2
You can suck my balls!,2
Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.,0
"Touché, teacher. Touché.",2
Dude. Sh-she's right.,0
"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.",1
"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!",0
"Yeah! You suck, Cartman!",1
"Hey, Timmy's back!",1
"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.",0
"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?",0
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.,1
But isn't he only three years old?,0
"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.",1
"But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.",1
"Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.",2
"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!",1
"Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.",2
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!,1
He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.,2
"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--",1
"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume.",2
"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!",1
"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.",0
But they smell like pee.,0
You are?,1
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?,0
"Yeah, that's me.",2
"Yeahhh, you already know about it?",2
"Well...  ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!""",2
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!,1
"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?",0
"No, I don't! I don't care!",1
"Here, Kyle.",2
And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?,2
Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.,2
"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.",2
"Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.",2
"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!",1
"Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.",2
I'm gonna!,1
Hold it.,2
I will!,1
"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.",0
"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.",2
"Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.",2
"Okay, that's cool.",2
"A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some--",2
Ugh..!,2
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper!,0
"You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device.",2
What the hell just happened?,0
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.,1
Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!,2
"It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!",2
Got ya!,2
"Whoa, dude..!",1
"Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?",2
"Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.",2
"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?",0
"Wow, that's amazing.",0
"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.",1
"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?",0
You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?,2
"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!",0
"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!",2
"Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes!",2
That should do it.,1
"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?",0
Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!,0
"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.",2
"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!",1
"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!",0
Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!,2
But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.,2
"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!",1
"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home.",2
Ech! Screw you guys. Home.,2
Hey! What are you doing?,1
Oh... Okay.,1
"Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!",0
Can I do it?,0
"Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!",0
"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.",0
"Yeah, that'd be faster.",1
He's right there.,0
"Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--",2
"Oh, cool.",2
Whoa...,2
Here we go again.,1
"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves.",0
"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--",2
"Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper!",0
"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--",2
Huh?,2
"Dammit, Cartman, open up!",1
"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!",2
"Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom.",0
Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.,1
You break it down!,0
"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!",1
"Not it! You lose, Kenny.",0
You ba--!,1
Why is that bad?,1
Then we have to stop it before it gets there!,0
"Step on it, Bill Cosby!",1
"Cartman, you have to stop!",0
He is in there.,0
"One-two-three, not it!",0
"Not-- Aw, damnit..!",1
"What are you doing, Kyle?",2
"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.",1
"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.",2
"Screw you, fat ass!",1
"Hey, screw you.",2
Cartman!,1
Agh--!,2
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.,0
I can't reach the CPU.,1
"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell.",0
"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!",0
Got 'em!,1
"You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!",0
"Huh, that's a bitch.",0
"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.",2
"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!",0
"Awww, man...",2
"Alright, alright.  Kyle...",2
"I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.",1
"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.",0
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.,0
"Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!",2
'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.,0
Can we take a lunch break now?,1
"No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!",2
Uh-eally? Uh you think so?,0
"God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!",2
"What is it, Butters?",1
How good?,2
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!,1
"Oh yeah, we can't!",0
"Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!",2
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.,1
"Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.",2
"That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!",2
Okay!,1
This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!,2
"A smart one, that can do tricks.",1
"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!",1
"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!",1
"Alright, we'll take him. How much?",1
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!,1
"...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go!",1
"Aw, blow it out your ass!",1
"Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.",2
"Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?",2
It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.,1
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?,2
"Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...",1
"Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?",2
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?,1
"You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!""",2
"Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.",1
Cool! Can you get it for us?,2
No no!,2
"I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!",2
"But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.",2
"Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!",2
OP-pression!,2
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?,2
Yeh.,2
"Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?",2
"Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey.",2
"Timmy, we already got a turkey.",1
"No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!",2
"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.",1
"No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.",2
"Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys!",2
"Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!",2
"Dude, we need your turkey for our play!",2
"I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?",2
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.,2
"Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.",2
"Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything.",2
"Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good.",2
"Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!",2
What Butters?,1
"Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us!",2
"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit",2
Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.,2
Like what?,2
"Hey, that's not a bad idea.",2
"Oh, man!",2
"No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.",2
Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!,2
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?,1
"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay.",0
"You ready for the big show, Timmy?",1
"Where's Gobbles, Timmy?",0
"Alright everybody, let's take our places!",2
"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?",1
"I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.",2
"No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.",0
Helen!,0
"Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.",2
Union Mafia bastards!,2
Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!,2
"He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.",1
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!,2
"...Alright, fine! Get in costume!",2
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!,2
"Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!",2
"Hey, look!",1
They loved it! They LOVED it!,2
"Okay, here we go.",0
"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.",1
That's it?,2
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!,0
Butters told us their play was awesome!,1
"I can't do it, dude.",0
"Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.",1
"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!",1
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.,0
"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?",2
Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.,2
Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball?,2
"God, I have to everything around here!",2
"I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?",2
You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!,2
Fat camp?,2
"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!",2
"Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!",2
"Aw, dude, check this out.",1
That's so gross.,0
"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?",1
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.,1
I'll throw in five.,0
"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!",1
forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!,0
"Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?",2
No.,2
Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!,2
What's the matter?,1
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick.,0
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it.,1
"Well, at least you got it out of your system.",0
"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?",1
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.,1
"Oh, you guys!",0
"That's 19 bucks, Kenny!",1
"Kick ass, dude!",1
"You know, dude, there might be something to this.",0
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.,1
This... is... bullcrap!,2
I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.,2
Take it! I can't eat this crap!,2
"Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.",2
"Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!",2
"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!",2
"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!",2
Hunh?  Uuh!,2
"Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA!",2
We knew he wouldn't make it.,0
I don't believe it.,0
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.,1
Memememeee!,2
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.,1
Did you like the old one?,0
Good point.,1
"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.",0
Huh? Why not?,1
What's a prostitute?,0
"Chef, what's a prostitute?",0
"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?",0
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.,0
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?,0
Like what?,0
Is anyone starting to suspect anything?,2
"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!",2
Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.,2
"Suck my balls, 20!",2
"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed!",2
Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!,0
"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you?",1
"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?",0
"Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open!",2
"Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?",2
"Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.",2
"Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.",2
"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?",1
Six hours.,1
Great.,1
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!,0
For what?,1
For giving Howard Stern a hummer!,0
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!,0
Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!,1
I know!,0
"He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.",1
"...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!",1
"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.",1
"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!",1
"Deal, druggie!",0
"...65, 66, 67...",2
"Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!",2
"You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight!",2
"Well, screw you, fatasses!",2
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.",0
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!,1
"Come on. Throw the football, Ike.",1
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!,0
Hepatitis B?,1
"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!",2
...You got Raging Pussies tickets??,1
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!,0
Hold on. I'll be right back.,1
"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?",1
But all the guys are going!,1
"But Mom, I-",1
Ugh!,1
My parents said I can't go.,1
"Well, of course your parents said you can't go!",0
"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!",2
"Ah. Oh, now I already told them.",1
"Well, I guess you're screwed, then.",2
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later.,1
"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!",1
What's Cuba?,1
"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?",1
"Hoh, geez.",1
Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.,1
"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.",1
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!,1
"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!",1
But that's not fair! You lied to me!,1
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!,1
Well I wish I didn't have any parents!,1
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!,1
"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.",0
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!,1
"Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.",2
How?!,1
"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.",2
The police?,0
"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.",2
"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.",2
Wow! Three months without parents!,1
But what do the police do to them?,0
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.,1
"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""",2
"""My parents molestered me.""",1
"No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.",2
"What's ""bad touch""?",1
"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch.""",2
"Okay, molestered, bad touch.",1
"Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.",2
"Cool, thanks.",1
"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.",0
"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!",2
You guys! Come out here!,2
Notice anything?  Watch.,2
...Nothing.,1
"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested",2
Not one adult left?,1
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.,0
"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.",2
"Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.",2
"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!",2
"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.",2
"Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat.",2
"So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?",2
"Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need.",2
"You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.",0
How come you wanna help the fatass?!,0
The fatass. The mayor.,1
"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!",0
"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.",1
"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?",0
"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?",0
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.,0
"Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli.",0
"And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word.",0
"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider.",0
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.,0
"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die.",0
"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.",0
Yes. No foolies.,0
Where is your husband?,2
Seize her!,2
Awesu-home!,0
"Sure, outlander. I'll get it",1
Outlander!,2
"Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!",2
"Butters, calm down, alright?",2
"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it!",2
"Heh, heheh.",2
"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!",0
"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!",2
The Provider awakes!,2
"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.",0
"Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn.",2
"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.",2
Parents?,0
Parents. Mom. Dad.,1
"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.",0
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.,1
Take him down.,2
"Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us?",1
"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!",0
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?,1
"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.",0
"Hey, you guys came back!",0
Did you make it to your job interview?,1
"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.",1
Yeah. We're fine.,1
But you didn't do anything to me.,1
"But, you guys, I--",1
Huh.,0
Huh.,1
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?,0
Snow igloos kick ass.,2
"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.",1
"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me.",1
"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.",1
"Happy Chanukah, Mom.",1
Go away!,1
A-ah huh.,0
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!,1
Ho-o-oh.,0
"Okay, good. You're all here.",1
"What is this all about, Kyle?",0
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.,1
"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed.",2
"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.",1
"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?",2
"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!",1
Heh-tchoo!,2
"Dude, you sneezed on my back!",1
"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!",2
"Hey, look.  Hello?",1
"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-",1
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.,1
Family?,2
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.,1
"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.",0
My moms barely bought me any presents so far.,2
Sure we'll help!,1
Anything for more presents!,2
"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole!",2
Nobody's paying any attention.,0
This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.,0
"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing.",0
"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.",2
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?,0
"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!",1
"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.",2
"And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.",0
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!,2
"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!",1
"We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town!",1
We don't know anything about animation.,0
How hard can it be? Look at it.,1
"Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!",2
"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas""",0
Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.,1
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.,1
"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.",0
You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!,1
"Ah, Mr. Hankey?",1
"We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.",1
"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days.",1
"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.",1
Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!,0
"Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.",2
"That's not me, that's you!",0
"They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.",1
I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!,2
"God job, Butters.",1
"No, that's okay.",0
See ya!,1
"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.",0
"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later.",1
What's a hard p?,1
"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?",2
We wish-,1
...deh..OOOWW!!!,2
Hey!  Wait a minute!,0
"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?",0
"Well, yes, I think so.",1
"Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs.",0
"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--",1
"Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.",2
"Don't you oppress me, fat boy.",1
"Don't call me fat, buttfucker.",2
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!,1
"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this!",0
What's awesome?,0
That's not in the script  They do this all the time.,0
"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.",1
Easy.,0
Yeah. So what's the first syllable?,1
"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas",0
"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.",1
Okay.  One.,0
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot!,1
Kickass!,0
"Now, the next mouth.",1
"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas.",0
"Okay, where are the E-mouths?",1
E mouths...,0
"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?",1
1  2.,0
So how much done is that?,1
"""We wish you a m- Merry""",0
"Aw,  Jesus Christ!",1
"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames.",1
AAAAAAAA!,0
"Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!",2
"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!",0
"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!",2
Fine! We'll do it with out you!,1
"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!",0
We'll dub his voice over.,1
"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!",0
"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!",1
You love-,1
We love,0
-And I'll labor.,1
Tralala,0
You sit-,1
We sit.,0
-And I'll stand.,1
Tralalalala,0
"You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?",1
"""Awgh! I'm so fat!""",0
"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.",1
"""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!""",0
Cool! Now let's try the script!,1
"Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!",0
"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.",1
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew!,0
You wish-,1
We wish,0
-And I'll whittle.,1
"Let's all try to help a little, 'cause",1
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film.,0
"Thank you, thank you.",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!",1
"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that.",2
"Okay, Mr. Hankey!",1
"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!",0
You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!,0
Dreidel dreidel dreidel-,1
All that hard work.,1
But we spent it!,1
All that work!,1
For nothing.,0
"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.",1
I guess- we might as well- go home now.,2
What the--,1
They did it! They got it working!,1
...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.,1
"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.",0
"Yeah, ham.",2
No not ham!,0
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!,2
"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.",1
...Christmas is about something much more important!,0
Presents.,0
Ah.,1
"Don't you see, Kyle?",0
"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!",1
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.,0
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.,2
"Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.",1
Wow! Count me in!,0
Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.,2
Hey you guys! Look what I have!,1
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!,1
"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.",1
"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.",0
"You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!",2
"What, doughboy?",1
I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.,2
"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.",2
"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.",2
You'll never guess.,2
Guess.,2
"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?",1
"You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  ""Shit.""",2
"They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?",1
"They can't say ""shit"" on television!",0
"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.",2
Holy fucking shit!,0
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.,2
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.,1
"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!",2
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?,1
"Aw, come, on dude! This is history.",0
It's stupid!,1
"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?",2
"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!",1
"Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.",1
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!,1
"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!",2
"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?""",0
I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.,2
"Where are you going, Kyle?",0
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!,1
"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!",0
I don't really give a fuck!,1
I can't believe they actually said it.,0
"Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!",2
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!,1
"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?",2
"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?",1
"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.",2
"Oh, whatever.",1
"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!",0
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.,1
I don't get it.,2
Me neither.,0
"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!",2
"It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!",1
"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.",2
There's no sand in my vagina!!!,1
"This sucks. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.",0
"Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob.",2
What's meecrob?,0
"You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob.",2
"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!",1
"Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television.",1
"Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.",2
"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".",1
"Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.",2
"Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on!",1
"Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?",1
"No no! The word, ""shit"".",1
"Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.",2
"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".",1
"What's the Black Death, Chef?",0
"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.",1
"Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here.",0
Word of curse?,0
A... curse word.,1
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.,0
"You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.",2
"Cartman, this is serious!!!",1
"So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb.",2
Holy shit!,0
"Oh-Ho, gross!",2
"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire!",1
Kenny's got it. heh heh.,2
"We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!",1
"Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!",2
"Cartman, stop being an asshole!",1
"We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word.",1
"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.",1
...No.,1
"But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?",2
"Now what are we gonna do, Chef?",0
Oh shit!,0
What are we supposed to do with it?,0
Now what?,1
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.,1
It might hold the key to a curse.,0
"Dude, we need help from the British!",0
You know what it is?,0
"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word.",0
"Look, there's the F-word.",0
And asshole.,1
I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!,2
All the world destroyed?,0
"My house, too?",2
"Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina!",2
What a stupid voice.,2
It's okay. The curse has been lifted.,1
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.,0
"You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.",1
We're all saying the S-word too much!,1
"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.",1
"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.",0
"So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language.",2
Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!,0
Holy shi-  poop.,0
"Hah, I love you guys.",2
"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.",0
"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad.",0
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!,2
"Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??",0
"Yeah, he's excited.",2
"Hey, Butters.",2
"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!",0
"See ya, Dad!",0
"Jimmy's funny, dude.",0
"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?",0
"Hey, yeah!",2
"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?",0
"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.",0
"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!",0
"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!",0
"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.",2
"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!",0
"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.",2
"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose.",0
"I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.",0
"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-",0
...Asshole.,0
"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.",2
"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy!",0
"Hehe, I don't sound like that.",2
Cripple fight!,2
Awww!,2
"Man, this guy sucks.",2
"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!",0
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!,2
Kicked out? Oh no!,0
But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.,2
"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.",0
What do we want?,0
When do we want it?,0
"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures.",0
"Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do!",2
"Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit!",0
"That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!",0
"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly.",0
Cripple fight!,2
"Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside!",2
"Jesus Christ, dude!",0
We did it! We did it!,0
"So wait, did we do good?",0
"Eh, we kick ass.",2
"Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts!",0
"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.",0
What's going on?,0
"That's pretty cool, dude!",1
Who's this asshole?,2
"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.",1
"Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?",2
"Wow, that's cool!",1
How'd he do that??,0
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!,1
"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go.",1
"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!",2
His a-miracles?,0
When are we gonna learn magic tricks?,2
I'm not really happy.,1
My potential hasn't even been reached.,1
Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?,2
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.,1
"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....",1
"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.",1
"Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.",0
"No, I'm Stan.",0
You're Stan? Where's Kenny?,1
I'm Kyle.,1
"Heheh, guess who I am, guys?",2
"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.",0
What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.,1
"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.",0
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..,1
I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me.,0
I'm going home.,0
You said we're free to leave whenever we want,0
Move out of the way.,0
"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.",0
"That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.",0
"Okay, it's all clear.",0
What are we doing?,1
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.,0
"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.",1
"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!",0
"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.",1
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!,0
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.,1
"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!",0
I'm not going anywhere!,1
"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!",0
Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.,1
"Oh wait, who am I again?",0
You're Stan.,1
"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!",0
Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.,1
"Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.",0
"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore.",1
"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.",1
"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.",2
That's right.,1
"Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.",2
Cool.,2
"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.",1
"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?",2
"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.",2
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!,1
He's going to eat his own head.,2
How many tickets can we put you down for?,1
"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.",2
No you're not.,2
Great!,1
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.,1
"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.",2
"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a-",1
"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him.",2
HaaAAAA!,0
"Hi, Jesus. It's me,",0
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!,0
"I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.",0
Can you do it again?,0
That's it? That's how you did that trick?,0
"That trick sucks, Jesus.",0
"Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.",0
"But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.",0
This is a really good turnout.,1
"Dude, no way!",1
What's he doin' here?,2
Now how the hell did he do that?,2
Then what are we going to do.,0
Super best friends?,0
To where?,0
I am ready.,0
"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.",1
Yeah. Why is that good news?,1
Mass suicide?,1
"Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!",2
"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?",0
"Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!",1
"No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh?",2
It's just me.,1
Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?,2
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.,1
"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.",1
"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.",2
"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.",1
"That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.",2
"Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell?",1
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.,2
"What have you done, Cartman?!",1
"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.",2
"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.",2
"Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!",1
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!,2
I knew it.,0
"Wow, the Moses.",0
"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!",2
"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!",1
But it's the only way for us to be happy.,2
"Cartman, no!",1
Kyle! Kyle!,0
"Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!",0
"Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!",0
"Kyle, you can't kill yourself!",0
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water!,1
"Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .",2
"Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny!",0
Wagh.,1
"Hey, I was just about to do it.",2
"Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.",0
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.,1
"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.",0
"Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh",2
"Haha, hehahaha.",1
"Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah!",2
"Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?",2
"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?!",1
"Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.",2
What's no big deal?,0
"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.",2
...What the hell are you talking about?!,1
"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee!",2
"What's ""pubes""?",1
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.,0
Oh.  No you didn't!,1
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!,2
He's lying.,0
You wanna see 'em?,2
Hell no!,1
"Here, check 'em out.",2
"We don't wanna see them, Cartman!",0
"There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!",2
Uh what are those?,1
My pubes.,2
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.,2
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?,1
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha!,2
"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.",0
"Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.",2
"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!",1
Uh oo what?,2
"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!",0
Nuh uh!,2
Yuh huh!,1
But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?,2
"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!",1
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.,2
Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.,2
"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?",2
"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!",2
Just give me back my money...,2
"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!",2
"Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.",2
"Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...",2
"You will? Oh, cool!",2
"Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.",2
...Okay.,2
"Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit!",2
"That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!",2
"Cartman, can I give you some advice?",1
"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.",1
"He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!!",2
One please.,1
One please.,0
One please.,2
"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?",2
"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.",2
Racist!,2
"Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!",2
Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?,2
I don't believe you.,2
Pube fair?,2
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!,2
"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!",2
"Haha, charade you are, Scott!",2
"Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha!",2
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!,2
"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.",2
Can you tell me where the pube fair is?,2
"Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.",2
No- no such thing?,2
I'm Eric Cartman!,2
Aaah!!!,2
"A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here",2
"Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.",2
"Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...",2
"Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.",2
Yeah. Poor grandma...,2
"Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh.",2
"Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott!",2
Why??,2
Please Scott give me my money.,2
I beg you to give me back my money.,2
I'm a little piggy.,2
Here's my snout.,2
Oink oink oink.,2
"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!",2
What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?,2
Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!,2
"Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!",2
"Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.",1
"Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!",2
"Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!",2
What's in it for us?,1
"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?",0
"Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!!",2
"Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!",2
"There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.",2
"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off.",2
He said it was okay.,2
Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!,2
"Not like that, pony!",2
Whattayou mean?,2
How do I do that?,2
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!,2
"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!",2
"You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...",2
"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.",2
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.,2
"Radiohead. Yes, of course.",2
"Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?",2
"Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!",2
"You're welcome, Scott.",2
"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?",2
"That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?",2
"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?",2
"Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!",2
"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it!",2
"'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""'",2
"Oh my God, he killed Kenny.",0
That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!,2
"Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!!",2
"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?",1
"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!",2
Got what all figured out?,0
How to get Scott Tenorman back!,2
"Oh, Jesus!",1
"I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars.",2
"Okay, so what's the plan?",1
"It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?",2
"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!",2
"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!!",2
"You're such a dumbass, Cartman.",1
"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!!",2
Scott Tenorman?,1
"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.",1
"'Cause, we're his friends.",1
'Cause we hate him.,1
"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.",1
"Hello, Scott!",2
"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!",2
"Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!",2
"Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.",2
"A little penis-biting, perhaps?",2
"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?",2
"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good.",2
"Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!",2
"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.",0
"Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!",2
"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this.",1
What's so funny?,2
"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?",0
"Not yet, but they will be.",2
"Yeah, sure.",1
"Hey, Chef.",2
What contest?,2
"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.",2
"Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming!",2
"Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!",2
"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.",2
"Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!",2
"Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine.",2
"Alright.  Hey, this is great!",2
"Gawh, this is really good, Scott!",2
What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?,2
"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents.",2
"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""",2
Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah!,2
"Jesus Christ, dude!",0
"Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.",2
"Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.",1
Good call.,0
"Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks!",2
"Whoa, bummer, dude.",2
"Okay, dude, it's 3:30.",1
"Oh man, this is another rerun.",0
Are you sure? I haven't seen it.,2
"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.",1
Because I had an itch up my ass.,0
When are they gonna make new ones?,0
What's this?,0
You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!,2
Enough! I know!,0
Write the number down! Write the number down!!,1
Dude! Did you get 'em?,0
"I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!",1
Awesome! Give me mine!,2
Yep. Tomorrow night.,0
"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.",0
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.,1
"Well yeah, dude.",2
"No, dude, we really, really do.",0
"Uhuh, but that's why we're going.",1
"See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.",1
"Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!",1
"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.",1
"Yeah, he looks terrible.",0
Uuuuhh.,0
Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!,2
Phillip? That's not Phillip.,0
"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?",1
I think this new guy's funny.,2
"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.",0
We have to talk to Terrance.,1
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.,0
"Aw, dude, gay!",2
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.,0
"Man, this sucks!",0
"Don't talk to us, kid.",2
Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.,1
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.,0
Kenny's a random slut.,2
"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh.",1
"Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there!",2
"We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.",0
"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.",1
But where's Phillip?,0
"Phillip, your partner.",1
But the guy who replaced him sucks!,1
"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.",0
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?,0
But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.,1
"Oh no, dude.",0
"Uuuh, we didn't get them.",1
"They're not together anymore, dude.",0
"Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.",1
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.,0
"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.",1
Weak.,2
"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?",0
Phillip! Phillip!,0
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.,0
"Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-",0
But we need you!,0
"Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!",2
"He'll do it, dude.",0
"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.",1
"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day.""",1
Two thousand dollars.,0
"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.",0
"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.",1
"Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.",2
Ih-it'll be okay.,1
They said they'd come.,1
I'm sure they'll be here any minute.,0
He's here!,1
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?,1
"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.",0
"Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?",1
See? I told you it would work.,1
You can't leave! The show starts soon!,1
"We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.",2
"Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video!",1
"Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month.",1
"Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.",0
"Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!",1
"Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!",2
"I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!",1
"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.",0
Haaah!,1
Go! Run run run!,0
"Come on, Kenny, hurry up!",0
"Wait! dude, LOOK!",1
They're back!,0
It sure did.,0
"Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!",2
"Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.",2
Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?,2
God! She didn't take this long to die.,2
Great. Now can we go?,2
Ogh! God-damnit..!,2
"Mom, I wanna go home!",2
Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...,2
"Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!",2
Hoosajiggawha?,2
"Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?",2
"No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...",2
Egh...,2
"""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!""  ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez.""",0
"""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!""",1
"""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez.""",0
"""Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!",1
"Yeah, awesome!",0
"Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)",0
...Why?,0
Nuh uh.,1
"You'd better not be lying, Kenny.",0
"Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.",2
"I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.",2
On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...,2
"Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.",2
"Huh, I think God has plenty of money.",2
"What the hell are you doing, fatass?!",1
"Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank.",2
Kenny wasn't lying.,1
Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.,2
"Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?",0
"HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!",2
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!,1
"Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!",2
"No... No, this isn't possible.",1
"Yeah, it's unbelievable.",0
"No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?",1
"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money.",0
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?,1
"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.",2
"Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.",2
"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.",2
"Gentlemen, I thank you.",2
"Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?",0
"Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.",1
"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--",0
"Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow.",1
"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.",0
"Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah! Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!",2
"Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.",0
Great.,1
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.,1
"Heh, heh.  Sorry.",0
"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!",1
"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.",0
"Hunh, I guess you're right.",1
"Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.",2
"That does it, dude!",0
Where are we going?,1
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!,0
"Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.",2
"Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!",1
Hohohooho! Oowwww!,1
You sons of bitches!,2
"Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!",1
What the hell are you doing?!,2
"Aw, crap.",0
"Oh God, get me off of here!!",1
"Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!",1
"Alright, let's go.",0
That's right! You stay out!,2
"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!",0
My life can't get any worse!,1
You'll see! We'll get in!,0
"...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!",2
"Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.",2
"But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.",2
"Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.",2
But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.,2
Ugh... Two people?,2
"Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...",2
Lucky.,1
"Dude, are you okay?",0
"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?",1
"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.",0
Jesus.,0
"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.",1
"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?",1
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!,1
"Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day.",2
"I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.",2
The rest of you will just have to try another day.,2
"'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.",2
"...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?",2
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?,2
"Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!",2
"Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.",2
But I don't know how it works.,2
"Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.",2
"Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go.",2
Wait a minute! Who are you?,2
"HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!",2
"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!",0
I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!,2
"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!",0
Get him out of here!,2
"AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!",0
"Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....",2
Agh!  Agghh!,1
Awesome.,1
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?,1
Satan talked to God?,1
And that's it? That's the end?,1
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?,1
"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.",1
"...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today!",2
Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh...,1
"Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me!",2
AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!,2
"Hey, there you are!",2
Just give me my money back.,2
I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!,2
"You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!",2
"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!",2
"Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass!",2
"He-hey, that's my money!",2
What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!,2
"Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!",2
"No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.",2
"But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!",2
This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!,2
"Kyle, you gotta see!!",0
"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?",0
"Then damnit man, do it!",0
"It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair!",2
"Look, Kyle. Look.",0
"You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?!",2
I'M SO PISSED OFF!,2
"Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch!",2
"Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!",2
"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.",0
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie!,2
You are up there!,1
"""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!""",0
"""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies.""",1
"""That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures""",0
"""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!""",1
"""Scream for me, bitch!""",0
"""AAAAAAAH!""",1
"Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!",2
"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on!",2
"What's this all about, Kenny?",1
"Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on.",2
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.,2
"Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!",2
"Whoa, cool!",0
That's awesome!,1
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.,0
"Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.",2
"You ""beat off?""",1
That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?,2
"Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?",0
"Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here!",2
Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!,0
But it's super-cool!,0
"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.",0
"Red rocket, red rocket!",0
"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket.",0
My room? Why?,0
Why?! What's the big deal?!,0
"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out.",0
What things??,0
"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?",0
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.,0
"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?",1
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.,1
"Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-",0
What the hell is wrong with them?,1
"You guys, we just wanna know if you-",0
...A what?,0
AIDS?,2
Is that what you learned in sex ed?,1
Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.,2
"Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.",0
"But Wendy, we don't understand how that-",0
"Oh my God, dude.",1
"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.",0
"Yeah, we need condoms!",0
Yeah. Quick!,1
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?,1
"Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!",2
"Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.",0
"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.",1
Doesn't it give any other directions?,0
"Uh, what are ""studzes""",1
"Just put it on, Butters.",2
"Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?",2
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.,1
"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!",0
"I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!",2
Sure.,1
How do you feel?,0
Do you feel protected?,2
"Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.",0
"Man, this condom's driving me crazy.",0
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.,1
"Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier.",2
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.,2
So I don't get AIDS.,2
From sex??,0
"You mean, intercourse with a girl?",1
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!,0
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!,2
"Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!",1
"Yeah, come on guys, this is war!",0
Ha! They're your diseases!,0
Yeah! You get out of town!,1
"Here, talk to them, Butters.",2
"Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.",2
"Man, he's pretty good.",1
"Oh, bitch!",2
That does it! Attack!,0
"Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.",2
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.,0
"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?",0
Seventeen?,1
"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?",0
"Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.",2
HA! I killed you!,1
"HA, I blew your head off!",0
"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?",0
"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?",1
Let a man take a crap!,2
"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.",0
"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing",1
"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!",0
"I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.",2
"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?",1
"Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.",2
"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.",0
"Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through.",2
"Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.",2
This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.,2
"What is it, Mom?",0
"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?",1
The 2001 Okama GameSphere?,0
"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!",2
There it is. The Okama GameSphere.,0
"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.",1
"Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.",1
"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere.",2
"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!",0
"Awesome!  Oh, crap.",1
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.,1
"Dude, we got GameSphere.",0
"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake.",1
...O-kay.,0
"Thanks, Towelie.",1
No.,0
"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.",1
"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.",2
"Okay, turn it on.",1
"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.",2
"Oh, this is so cool.",1
"Bring it, bring it!",2
"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.",0
"Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.",2
"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?",1
Date-rape psychosis.,2
"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!",1
Awesome!,2
"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..",1
"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!",0
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!,2
"Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.",0
Uh no.,1
"Okay, we will.",0
No we don't wanna get high!,1
"Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!",2
"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!",0
That's... so... cool!,2
"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.",0
It's Monday?,2
"Oh, uh, I'm sick.",0
But Mom...,0
Can't believe we have to go to school!,0
"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.",1
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere.,0
What? You mean Towelie?,1
"What, dude?",2
This is gonna be one looong-ass day.,0
That was the longest day of school ever!,0
"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!",1
Where is it?,1
It... it was right here.,0
Where the hell is it??,1
"Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix!",2
What? Who-who is this?,0
Don't hurt it!,0
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.,0
No! ...No!,2
"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!",1
Towelie!,0
"Hey, towel!",2
Where the hell is he?,1
"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.",0
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.,1
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!,2
That's a towel call?,1
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.,0
"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.",1
"Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!",0
There he is!,1
"Come on, dude!",0
Just come on! It's getting dark.,1
Are you sure this is where they said to be?,1
They said the gas station outside of town.,0
Who is that?,0
"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.",0
"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!",1
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.,0
"Goddamnit, what now?!",0
"Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere.",0
Where is our Okama GameSphere?,0
"Aw, God-damnit!",1
"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?",0
"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys.",0
Are we getting close?,1
"A little more gas, Kenny.",0
How long has it been since you've been back there.,1
"Brake, Kenny, brake.",0
Egh!,2
"Dude, don't you remember where it is?",0
"Alright, so where is it?",0
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!,1
"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!",0
That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!,1
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!,1
This is where you came from?,2
"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?",0
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.,1
We don't care.,0
"Dude, we don't care.",0
We... don't... care.,0
"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?",1
Who's they?,1
"Don't care, don't care, don't care.",0
"Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!",2
"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?",0
"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?",0
"Dude, I figured it out.",1
"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!",1
"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?",0
Seven and a half.,1
"Hurry up, stupid parachute!",0
"Alright, I think we go over there.",2
"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.",0
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!,2
"I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!",2
"Yeah, and you're a towel!",2
"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter.",0
That's it?,1
"No, Towelie, the entry code!",0
"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.",0
Well let's look in here.,1
Do you have our Okama GameSphere?,0
"Oh God, don't care, don't care.",0
What terrifying secret?,1
"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?",2
And we don't care.,1
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.,0
Go ahead.,1
But we don't care!,0
We're just going in to get our video game back.,0
"Photon rifle, whatever.",1
"Hello? Hello, anybody here?",0
"Ohmigod, look!",0
Our GameSphere!,1
"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays.",0
"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.",2
Sweet!,1
"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!",0
Could you turn it up?,2
"Hup hup. Come on, hang on.",2
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer!,1
"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart!",0
I've almost got it!,1
"Aw, crap!",0
"Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!",2
I got it!,1
"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!",0
"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!",0
Awesome!,1
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.,1
"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.",0
"You're the worst character ever, Towelie.",2
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?,1
...Not really.,2
"These are gas masks, Butters!",1
"Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!",0
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.,0
"Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.",1
Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.,2
"Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?",2
God-damnit!,2
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!,2
"Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!",2
"That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.",2
"Yes, but they're sand monkeys!",2
"God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!",2
"Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.",0
"Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!",0
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?,0
Well alright.,0
"Dude, what's going on?",1
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.,0
"Oh, it's just a goat.",0
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.,0
"Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.",2
Well what are we supposed to do with it?,1
"Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.",0
"Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.",1
Kenny?,0
My parents will never let me keep a goat,0
"Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.",2
"No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat.",0
"Uh oh, they're closing!",1
"Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?",0
"It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.",2
They're not.,0
"Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them.",0
"Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.",1
I don't care! We're going!,0
"Oh no, not Towelie.",2
"Okay, thanks, Towelie.",0
"No, we don't wanna get high!!",2
"Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!",0
"Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.",0
"Okay, it's clear. Come on!",0
"Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.",0
"Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.",0
"'K, let's put him on here.",0
"Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.",0
"Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?",2
"Aw, son of a bitch!",2
"Hey, wait! There are children in here!",1
"Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.",0
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse?,1
"Uh ho, you guys.",2
"Oh God, it was horrible!",1
Twenty hours!,0
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!,1
It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.,2
"Uh, whatever!",2
"You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people!",1
"Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!",2
"Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address.",0
"God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!",2
"Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!",1
Hey look! There's a taxi!,0
Hello. We need to go...  here.,0
What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?,2
Is this the right house?,1
I think so.,0
"A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?",0
Here. Wu-we don't want it.,0
"No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.",0
"It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country.",2
"Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift.",0
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!,1
"Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.",0
What did you call us?!,2
Then why did you send us the goat?,1
"Hey! Hey, open the door!",0
I told you! Jawas have no heart.,2
Jawas?,1
"You know, sand people.",2
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?,0
"Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!",1
"Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.",0
"God, I hate you so much, Stan!",2
What?  Howdy.,0
"Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?",1
"Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!",2
"Cartman, you stupid asshole!",0
"Good job, fatass!",1
"Dude, don't call me a Canadian!",2
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies!,0
"Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-",2
"Oh crap, it's him!",1
"Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.",2
"Dude, these people are insane.",0
"Hey, what are you guys doing here?",0
But I thought you hate us.,1
"Cartman, where are you going??",1
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!,2
"Cartman, he's crazy!",1
"He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people.",2
"Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden?",2
"Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh",2
Uh oh! Mmm-mm!,2
Where do we go?,1
"Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.",0
Hey look! An infidel!,2
So that's what this is all about?,2
Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!,2
Woohoo!,2
"All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.",1
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?,0
...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!,0
Haduqaduqaduqa.  Huqadukadukadukaduuu.,2
"Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!",1
"...He's got us there, dude.",0
There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create!,2
"Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.",2
"Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh, and here's your microphone.",2
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.,1
"Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.",0
"Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.",0
I'm confused.,1
"Come on, let's go get to the plane.",0
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.,1
"No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.",0
Go America.,0
Go America.  Go Broncos.,1
"Yeah, go Broncos.",0
I didn't smile.,0
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!,1
Did you go yet?,0
No. This is taking forever.,1
You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!,2
"What, Cartman?",1
"Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here!",2
"It isn't that funny, Cartman.",1
Yes it is!,2
"...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.",2
But I never take off my hat.,1
This is how I look natural.,1
Crap.,1
Gay-ass.,1
"Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?",2
"Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!",2
"Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!",2
YES! YES!,2
"Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!",2
Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle!,2
"Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!",2
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.,2
"Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!",2
"Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton?",2
"Yes, I have it right hmya.",2
"You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.",2
"Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye!",2
"And, and big rosy cheeks!",2
"Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking!",2
You guys! You guys! You guys!,2
...You guys!...,2
You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry.,2
What's he want?,0
I don't know. Let's go see.,1
Why'd you call us?,1
"Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!",2
"Goddamnit Cartman, what?!",0
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??,1
"Look at, look at the description. Brown eye!",2
"That isn't funny, Cartman.",0
"Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!",2
"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.",1
"No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.",2
"...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?",1
"Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid.",2
"...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.",0
"No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be!",2
...Nuh uh.,1
"Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh.",2
"Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!",1
No way!,0
Oh my... God.,2
"Cartman, where are you going??",0
Uh,1
"Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.",1
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.,0
"Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?",1
"Yeah, you missed them turning around.",0
"You guys, something's wrong.",2
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.,2
Blew a funny fuse?,1
It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?,2
"Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.",0
How the hell should we know?,0
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!,1
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.,1
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.,0
"But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!",0
Alright.,1
"Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?",2
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.,2
"You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.",2
So does that mean I'll never laugh again?,2
Ugh.,2
"Oh, dude, oh.",2
Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-,2
Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here!,2
"Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.",2
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.,2
"Okay, let me have it.",2
"Okay, why?",2
"...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.",2
Who's there?,2
Orange who?,2
"...naw, that didn't work either.",2
An interrupting cow who,2
Butters! Hey Butters!,1
"They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!",1
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?,0
"Dude, that poor kid.",1
"Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.",2
And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.,2
"Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.",2
What's goin' on?,2
"Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!",0
"Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.",1
"Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.",2
"Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.",0
"Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck!",2
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?,1
"A-heh, what?",2
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.,1
"When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.",1
"Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.",0
"E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.",2
"There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.",1
"Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny!",2
"Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.",0
"Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.",1
"Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.",0
What's he look like?,1
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother.,1
"Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?",1
"Oh is, is this beef?",1
"Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.",1
"Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-",1
"We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.",1
"What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?",1
"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?",1
"Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.",1
What's that thing?,2
"Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.",1
Forty bucks?,2
"Alright, alright.",2
"Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?",2
I can't believe how cold it is out here.,1
Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.,2
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.,1
"Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?",1
"...Oh, man.",2
"Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here.",2
"Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.",1
"Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.",2
"...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.",1
I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!,2
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.,1
"Eh, oh, alright.",1
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.,1
"Ugh, ugh!",2
"Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?",1
"Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!",2
"Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.",1
"Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?",1
But it's down in the snow.,1
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.,1
"Alright, then.",1
"Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.",2
"Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.",2
"No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh?",2
"Goddamnit, give me another chance!",2
Uh you did what?,1
"Haha,  serves you right, asshole.",2
"You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?",1
"Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.",1
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.,1
"Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.",1
Boy it sure is dry out here.,1
"I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.",0
"Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.",0
I'm ba-ack!,1
"Book. Later, dude.",0
"I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.",1
"It seems like I might get splinters, though.",1
"Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.",1
"I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus!",1
It's a least a couple of hours.,1
He's faaahn.,2
I'm ba-ack.,1
I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus.,1
"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.",1
"Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.",1
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.,1
"Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.",0
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?,1
"Oh, Jesus!!",1
"1, 2, 3, 4...",2
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.,1
"Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had-",1
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home.,0
"Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!",1
I'm back.,1
"Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.",1
"So dude, did Cartman's idea work?",0
Damn!,0
"Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.",1
"Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.",1
"Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin.",1
"Yeah, haha.",0
Heheheheheh.,2
"Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.",1
Re- really?,1
"I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.",2
"Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.",1
"I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya.",1
"...Good job, Jew!",2
"Stand by, please.",2
"Oh, god dammit!",2
Haha!,1
"Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.",2
Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!,2
I'll make you eat your parents!,2
Nothing!,2
"Aw, that is such bullcrap!",2
"No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!",2
"Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!",2
"Your family is rich, dude.",0
"Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!",2
Aharmani Exchange?,1
"All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so!",2
"Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.",0
"Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.",2
"Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?",0
"Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.",2
"Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway.",0
DVD? We don't own a DVD player.,0
"Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.",1
"Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently.",2
"Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it.",2
"Oh, Jesus, dude.",2
"Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do.",0
What's a VHS?,1
What in the hell are they doing?,2
Is that fun?,1
"I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.",0
"Well, let's just play our game, then.",2
Alright.,1
"Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny!",2
"I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan!",1
"I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!",0
Kick his nutsack!,2
"Oh hey, there's Token.",0
"Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?",0
"Sure, dude, you're our friend.",0
"Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.",0
"Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.",1
"Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.",0
Right.,1
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.,1
"Yeah, I get it for that.",0
And Cartman for being fat.,1
And Cartman for being stupid.,1
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.,1
Hey.,2
And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole,1
"Ey, you did me already!",2
"Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.",0
"No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.",1
"Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.",0
"Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.",1
Pussy.,2
My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah?,2
Well that burned a long time.,0
"Yeah, that was pretty good.",1
"Oh dude, there goes one.",0
'K go!,1
"You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?",1
Tell him we're busy.,0
"What, did he lose a hundred pounds?",1
"Alright, let's go see what he wants.",0
"Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!",1
"Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!",2
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?,2
A trampoline?,1
Better.,2
A boat?,0
"Well WHAT, Cartman?",0
Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.,2
...What?,1
"Mint condition, tax free.",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!",0
I'm leaving right now!,1
"Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!",2
"You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!",1
"Stem cells, numbnuts!",2
Stem cells?,0
"Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!",1
"They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.",1
"It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.",2
...I hate you so much.,1
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!,2
"Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good.",2
"Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?",2
"Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?",2
"You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.",2
"...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!",2
"Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit!",2
"Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.",0
"Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.",1
"The principal? Aw, come on!",0
"We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!",1
"Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.",1
Wait. What's going on here?,0
"Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.",1
Kenny's sick?,1
Well how sick?,0
"...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?",0
"Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.",0
Wait. Kenny's going to die?,1
...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.,0
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!!,0
"Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back.",2
"Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.",2
"Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?",2
Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?,2
"Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.",2
Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.,2
"What is this, a PTA meeting?",2
Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.,1
In the ...hospital? Why?,2
"They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die.",1
Die? Kenny?,2
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!,0
"Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat.",2
"Hey dude, how's it going?",1
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.,2
"Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.",1
"Heh, sorry.",2
"Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?",1
I-,0
"Stan?  Stan, where are you going?",1
"I can't, I just can't.",0
"Dude, he needs us right now.",1
"I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.",0
"I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!",1
"And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!",0
"Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!",1
Just leave me alone!,0
"Stan, you can't leave!",1
"I'm not the one who's leaving, he is!",0
"...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.",2
"Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay!",2
"Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy?",2
"Cartman, were you... crying?",1
"' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.",2
"Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too.",1
"I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.",2
"Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.",1
"Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?",2
"Not at all, but go on.",2
"So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.",2
"Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!",2
Hmmm.,2
Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind.,2
"There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.",2
"Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks.",2
"Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind.",2
"...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane!",1
"Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.",1
"Neat, huh Kenny?",1
He said his wish is not to die.,1
"He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself.",1
"Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?",0
"But then, why does God give us anything to start with?",0
I think I understand.,0
"My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do",2
"And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.",2
"Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.",2
"Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus?",2
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.",2
Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.,2
"Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.",0
"Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.",0
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.,1
"But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?",0
"He just said... ""Where's Stan?""",1
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend.,0
You guys! Come quick!,2
"It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys!",2
"What, Cartman? What's happened?",0
"Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked!",2
"This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?",0
Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!,2
"I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.",1
"I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.",2
AAARGH!,1
Aah! Kyle!  Kyle!,2
"Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was!",0
Butters was missing?,0
Huho!,2
"Damn, dude.",0
"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.",0
We sure are.,2
"Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys.",2
"Hello, is this City Wok?",2
"Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.",2
"Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.",1
"Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!",0
Hey Kenny,0
"Okay, Not-Kenny.",1
Dude! That's today!,1
"We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny!",0
"Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.",2
Excuse me? Could we get through here?,1
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.,2
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?,1
What kind of help?,0
A- AIDS?,2
I'll bet you can.,0
Them?,1
"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides.",1
"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.",1
"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.",1
"It matters, dude.",1
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.,1
"Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.",0
Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.,2
Tha- that's diarrhea.,1
"Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.",2
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.,0
"That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.",2
That's a great idea!,1
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.,2
"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?",2
"I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!",2
But Butters isn't fat.,1
"That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.",2
"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.",0
"Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!",2
Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!,1
"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters.",0
He used to be fat but not no more,2
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.,1
"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls",0
and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.,2
"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.",1
"Uuuh, school project.",2
Marry him?,0
"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.",1
"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise.",1
"Chef, we need more food.",0
Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!,2
"Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.",0
So how long until we can joke about it?,2
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.,1
"Wugh, that's a long time to wait.",2
Then eat your puke.,2
"Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it.",2
Wow! He looks great!,1
"How do you feel, Butters?",0
"Get a hold of yourself, man!",2
"Alright, now it's time for phase 2.",0
"Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.",2
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.,1
The fat one!,2
"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.",0
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.,1
Just like Jared.,2
"Sir, we are in business!",2
"Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!",2
"Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.",2
Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!,2
Did you bring the camera?,0
"Yeah, we're all set.",1
"Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.",2
"Well, what do you mean?",1
"Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.",2
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.,0
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.,2
"Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.",2
Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!,0
"Yeah, you're still fat!",1
"Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!",2
"No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!",2
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!,0
Why are you doing this to us?!,1
All prepared for liposuction surgery?,0
"Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters.",0
"Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.",1
That should blah  ah- here.,2
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!,2
"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision.",1
Alrighty.,2
"Alright, I think it's in.",2
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat.,1
"Bohogh, egh.",2
There it goes.,2
"Alright, it's working!",1
"Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.",2
"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.",0
We've gotta hurry this up.,0
"Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.",2
He's losing weight.,0
"Oh, whoa. Whoa!",2
It's out of control!,1
"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.",0
"Oh, crap!",2
"Dude, bail!",0
"Come on, Butters. Time to go.",0
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!,1
"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!",2
...Kenny would have done it.,0
Yep.,1
"Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.",2
"Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.",2
"Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.",2
"Wow, that was pretty good.",1
"Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters.",0
"Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine!",2
Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?,2
"Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.",2
"Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.",2
"Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.",2
"Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes!",2
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.,1
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!,0
"Uh, why not?",1
Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?,0
"Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out.",0
"Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.",2
"Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.",2
Wait!  You're all making a mistake!,1
"No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS,"" AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.",0
"Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?",0
Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!,0
Oh God-damnit!,0
"Aw, just forget the whole thing then!",1
"Well, so much for our money.",0
"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.",1
"No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!",2
"No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!",2
"Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.",2
Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back.,2
"Butters, it was my pleasure.",2
"Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.",2
"Look you guys, Butters is asleep.",2
He's such a douchebag,0
"Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it...",2
"Yeah, and then what?",0
"And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.",2
"No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.",1
"Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh",2
They're still asleep.,0
"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!",2
What,1
"So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.",2
What's a Hitler?,0
"You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?",2
"No, I never have.",0
"Shh-shh, here he comes.",2
"Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!",2
Smell what?,0
I don't smell anything. Do you guys?,2
"Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen.",2
His name is Thumper?,2
"Go on, Ike.",1
"...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.",1
"Ugh, no more.,",2
"Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.",0
Uhh... no.,0
Stan. Marsh.,0
"Dude, I'm just learning.",0
I never said I was.,0
...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...,0
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.,1
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.,0
Heather?,0
...who are you people?!,0
"All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?",0
"Yeah, prob'ly",0
Fries... fries...,0
"Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with.",0
Thanks. Who are you?,0
"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!",1
I' seems fine.,0
Don't care.,0
What do you wanna do now?,1
"Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body.",2
"Oh,. God.",0
"Gah, let's go you guys.",0
"Dude, what the hell is your problem?!",0
"I raced you, You won!",0
"I'll be there, you queen!",0
"Dude, I have to!",0
"Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.",1
"Dude, he's got Heather!",0
You don't even know Heather!,1
"I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?",0
...Thank you.,0
"Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.",1
"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!",0
That does it! I'm calling the police!,0
"Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.",0
"I have to do this, okay? I have to!",0
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches.,1
Pizza... pizza... pizza...,0
"Awgh, dude, I can't look.",1
"Good job, dude!",1
"Mom, Dad!",1
Where the hell have you guys been?!,0
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks!,0
"Yeah, what a stupid sport!",1
"Hm, that sounds pretty good.",0
Hey Kenny!,0
"That's awesome, Kenny.",2
"Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.",0
"Aww, sick dude!",2
"This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!",1
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!,0
Oh YES!!,2
Do you think they'll believe it?,1
What disease should we say?,0
"Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis.""  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?",2
"Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!",2
"Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!",2
This is gonna be so funny!,0
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?,1
"We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?",0
"Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.",2
"Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!",1
"It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.",0
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.,1
Kenny woulda done it.,0
"We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.",1
"Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.",2
"Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand.",0
Where's you get the balls from?,0
Nice.,2
That looks awesome!,1
"They look great on you, Butters. They really do.",2
"All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I",0
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.,1
"Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls.",2
"That's your flight, Butters.",0
"Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York.",2
"Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.",0
"God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?",2
"Yeah, he sure is.",1
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend!,0
Buh-ters! Buh-ters!,2
Here he comes.,0
This is gonna be awesome!,1
Testicles and scrotum!,2
"Uh oh, we're losin' him.",2
"Oh, that was close.",2
The present.,2
"Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""?",2
"But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!",0
Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!,1
Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!,2
"Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?",2
What's the new topic?,2
"Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!",2
"Uh, sure!",2
"Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies",2
"...my, my mom?",2
Mmoooomm?,2
Could yo do me a favor?,2
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?,2
"I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?",2
"Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.",2
"Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.",2
"Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?",0
"Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.",0
I- told them where to find you.,0
"Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over.",0
"Jeez, that girl is pissed off.",2
"But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?",2
"Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!",2
"Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!",2
"Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.",2
What-evah! What-evah!  I'll do what I waunt!,2
Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!,2
"What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!",2
I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!,2
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!,2
Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants!,2
"Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time!",2
Aaahh!,2
City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.,1
They look so delicious.,2
"Aw, dude.",1
Memememee!,2
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??,0
"Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??",1
"Yeah, I wouldn't have.",0
"Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious",2
"Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?",2
Alriiight!,2
"Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.",0
"Pst, Cartman.",0
"No, Uncle Jesse, no!",2
"Cartman, wake up!",0
What? What the hell are you guys doing??,2
"Come on, we've gotta go!",1
Where are we going?,2
"We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!",0
What? Why?,2
"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!",1
"So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!",0
"Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend.",2
"We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.",0
"Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!",0
Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!,2
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?,0
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass.,2
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.,2
"Screw you, Cartman!",1
"Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.",2
"Go on, dude it's the only way.",0
Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.,2
"Just do it really fast, and we can go.",0
Have Butters kiss it.,1
"No, it has to be Kyle.",2
Awww!,1
"Oh man, that was soho awesome!",2
Sick! I felt it on my face!,1
"Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!",0
"Hell, I'm not goin' with you!",2
Hyaaaa!,1
Heeeey!,2
"Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?",0
"Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof.",2
"Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.",0
You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.,2
"I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.",0
"Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.",2
You need to freeze some of your ass off.,1
"O! At least I have as ass, Jew!",2
"Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here.",0
They aren't leaving.,0
See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.,2
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.,1
"Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.",0
"Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.",0
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?,1
"I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.",2
"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!",1
"We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys.",0
"Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling.",2
"Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.",2
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.,0
Butters has that at his house?,1
Butters!  Did you bring it?,0
All right!,1
"Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?",1
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!,0
"They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.",0
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer!,0
Kiss my ass!,0
"You're getting in pretty deep, dude.",1
So what happens now?,1
"I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.",0
"We're with you, dude.",1
"Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.",0
I want out.,2
"Shut up, Cartman.",0
"We're with you, Stan.",1
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.,0
Yeah! Wait-what?,2
...No I won't.,1
"Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!",1
"Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.",0
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...,1
"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.",0
"Oh, God-damnit you guys.",2
"Cartman, stay away from that door!",1
Round one is over. We made it.,0
"We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!",2
"Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.",0
"But we will have to sleep, dude.",1
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.,0
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes!,0
Good night.,1
"Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.",2
Can't go on. Need... food...,2
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.,1
"There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.",2
"No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!",0
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters.,2
"He might be right, dude.",1
"Wait, what is that?  Dude!",0
Food!,2
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!,0
Look you guys! Beef jerky!,2
Yeah! And fried chicken!,1
Wha?,0
"Dude, what are you guys doing?",0
"We're eating, dude.",1
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!,0
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.,1
"Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.",2
"That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!",0
"Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?",2
"Dude, that's messed up.",1
"You guys, check this out!",1
"No, this is exactly what we wanted.",0
It is?,1
"Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.",0
...I don't believe it.,0
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me!,0
"Huh, what the hell is that?",1
Hippies!,2
What are they doing here?,0
Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?,1
"What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!",2
"Dude, are you okay?",1
"Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores.",0
"Dude, maybe we should end this.",1
"Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?",0
Don't give him anything!,1
What do I say??,0
"Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.",2
"Sure, sure.",2
What do you have in mind?,2
"Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.",2
"All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -",2
"Cartman, no!",0
"We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.",2
"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.",2
"Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.",2
Hello.,2
"All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf.",2
"Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?!",2
O-ogh...,0
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here!,2
"Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else!",2
"Stan's getting worse, you guys.",1
"Mike, speak.",2
"We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?",2
"Good, good.",2
"Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.",2
And Worf?,2
Stan! It worked!,1
It... did?,0
"They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!",1
Pick me up. I... I want to see.,0
Step back! Tell those men to step back!,2
"Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as ""Captain.""",2
"No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?""",2
You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.,2
"""Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!""",2
"Okay, all set!",2
"Step on it, Mr. Worf!",2
Mexico here we come!,1
"Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!",2
"""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?""",2
"Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.",2
"Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.",1
"Oh, it's a double-cross!!",2
Oh no! No!!,1
"What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!",2
Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!,2
"We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!",0
"Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan??",1
Thank God we stopped it in time.,2
"Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.",0
"But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.",1
This is gonna be so awesome!,0
Do we have everything?,1
"Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!",0
"Look, it's almost time.",1
"Alright, here we go.",0
"Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!",0
"No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC!",0
"It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!",0
It's the biggest night of the year.,1
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.,0
"Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?",2
"I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!",2
"But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.",0
"Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!",0
"O-K, deal.",0
"Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/",1
"Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.",0
You'd miss the new trailer?,1
"Dude, I'm not going.",0
"Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name?",2
Stan.,0
"Stan, okay. What's your name?",2
Kyle. What's your name?,2
"Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.",2
"Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.",1
"Dude, thank God for stupid people",1
Amen.,2
"Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?",0
"What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated.",2
They look fine to me.,0
"Just don't mess with it, Cartman.",1
"Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose.",2
Just just leave it alone.,1
"Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that?",2
That's worse!,0
"Okay, how about ... that?",2
God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!,1
"It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!",2
"Dude, the commercials could start any time!",0
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.,2
"God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!",1
Get all the stuff!,0
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on!,0
Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!,0
Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!,2
"Huff, huff",0
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet.,1
Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.,2
"No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it!",1
"God, when is this gonna get to the commercials?",2
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer,1
"But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.",1
"God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.",1
Aww!,0
We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.,2
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on!,0
Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!,2
"God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!",1
"Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?",0
"There, you got it, you got it!",2
"Oh, thank God.",2
"We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.",2
Here they come!,0
"Heuh, the commercials!",1
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.,0
"Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.",1
"This TV is great, Chef.",2
"Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon.",0
"Get it back to normal, Chef!",1
Oh God-dammit!,0
The TV left.,1
"Come on, we gotta go somewhere else!",0
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!,0
Aagh! God-dammit!,2
We made it.,0
This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.,2
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!,1
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.,0
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.,2
"Come on, we gotta get to a TV!",0
"Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!",2
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it!,2
We're not too late!,1
Here we go!,2
Commercial Break Number Two!,0
That's it? That's all the commercials?,2
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!,1
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.,0
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!,1
Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!,2
"Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!",2
Eewww!,2
"Oh, God, it's horrible!",0
"That'd disgusting, dude!",1
"God, I hate old people!",2
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!,0
And my house is being fumigated!,2
"Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!",0
"It's okay, it's still the show.",1
"Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.",1
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!,0
Will your sister let us watch it?,1
She has to!,0
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!,0
"Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!",2
Look! Crack addicts with a television!,1
The last commercial break has to be coming on any second!,0
Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??,1
"We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??",0
Well why not?!,1
"Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!",2
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!,1
"Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later!",0
"The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on!",2
We made it!,0
The last commercial break is starting!,1
These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!,2
"Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??",0
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?,1
"You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.",2
That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!,1
"Wait a minute! Look!  ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it!",0
Woohoo!!!,2
That looks AWEsome!,0
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see??,1
"Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.",2
"You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.",2
"Oh, dude, let's go!",0
"It looks even better than their first movie, huh?",1
"Yeah, it sure does!",2
I wonder if it's all a western?,0
"Okay, here he comes.",0
Who wants to tell him?,1
I'll do it.,2
"Butters, could you take a seat, please?",2
"Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.",2
"Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap.""",2
"Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.",2
"I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...",2
Lame,1
"Lame, yes.",2
"Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.",0
"But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.",1
"Yes, well, we weren't.",2
"We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.",1
"But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right?",2
"Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.",1
Who cares?,2
"All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.",0
"All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?",2
"Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.",2
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.,0
I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy.,2
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.,1
"...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop.",2
"Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.",1
"We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...",2
"Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points.",2
"But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.",1
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.,0
"All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?",2
Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy,1
Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .,1
"Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?",2
Tweek.,1
"All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out!",2
"All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.",0
"Okay, next?",0
This looks pretty good.,1
"Yeah, it's not bad. Next?",0
Next?,2
"Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.",2
Alrighty then.,2
"Uh, what's the question again?",2
Five times one is of course...,2
Five.,2
"You're such a fatass, Cartman!",1
"Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!",2
"Shut up, fatass!",0
"Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much.",2
"All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?",2
Token.,1
Timmy.,1
Tweek.  Pip,1
Towelie.,1
"Just one more rose, Kyle.",2
Jimmy.,1
"All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out!",2
"Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!",2
The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates.,2
Next please.,2
"Anything that'll impress us, Token.",1
"If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?",2
Very nice.,2
I like it.,0
"Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.",1
Yeah! Isn't this great?!,1
"You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!",2
"All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next!",2
"Okay, let's try this.",0
"Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?",2
"Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend?",0
I think Towelie is awesome.,2
"Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.",1
"Oh, this is giving me a headache.",0
"Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.",1
"You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.",0
"Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.",2
How about Token?,0
Token's a smartass.,2
So? You're a smartass!,1
Yeah. Do we really need another one?,2
Good point.,1
"Oh, thanks Jimmy",2
That's great.,0
"Alright Jimmy, see ya.",2
Suckup.,0
"Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend.",2
"Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to?",2
"Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek.",0
Just stick it on.,1
Just put it between his eyes.,0
"Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?",0
"Oh, hey Butters.",0
"Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny!",1
"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it!",2
"Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!",2
"No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!",2
"Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.",2
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.,2
"Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!",2
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars.,1
"If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!",2
"Alright, I'll chip in.",0
"Ah, alright.",1
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...,2
"Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.",2
"Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies.",2
"Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  ""Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.""  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?",2
Ready. Let's see 'em.,0
"Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go.",2
Are they playing basketball?,0
What the fuck is this?!,2
"Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.",0
I got RIPPED OFF!,2
"I told you, Cartman.",1
"Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep",2
What are we gonna do with them?,0
Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!,2
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.,1
"Yeah, that'd be funny.",0
"Heheh, okay, okay.",2
"Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!",2
"Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!",2
"See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.",1
"Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.",0
"Oh jeez, change the channel.",0
"They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!",0
Oh God!,1
We're dead!,0
Tweek! Where are you going?,2
"Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!",0
"Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!",1
"In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.",2
"Chef, we did something kind of bad.",0
We don't know who else to talk to.,1
We need you to promise not to tell anybody.,0
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach,0
So what should we do?,0
"Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.",1
"We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.",2
This is it.,0
"Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.",2
"Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word!",2
"Yeah, stupid.",0
There's nothing here!,1
"Dude, it's probably in her stomach.",0
Is it her?,2
"Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.",1
What do we do now?,0
"Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...",2
Do you see the sea people.,0
"No, just a bunch of goo.",2
Ms. Choksondik stinks inside.,1
Aaah!,0
Quick. Hide.,1
Got it!,1
Let's go!,0
"There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands.",2
"It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!",2
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.,0
...and then we put them back in the tank.,0
"Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.",2
"Oh, really??",1
"Okay. Goodnight, Cartman.",0
"G'night, guys.",2
I'm so glad we're not murderers.,1
"Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal.",2
H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!,2
"Oh no, what now?",0
"Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK!",2
Wow. How did that happen?,0
"I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.",2
Whoa.,1
They've already accomplished so much.,0
"That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!",2
"You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.",2
Well what are you gonna do?,1
Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.,2
"Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?",2
Do you have them or not?,2
What's your name?,2
"Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound?",2
"I see, very interesting.",2
"Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.",2
"No, gallons.",2
"Damint! Give me all you've got, then!",2
"Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.",0
"That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?",2
"Well, drop them in!",0
And I've got the sea men.,2
"Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.",1
"Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.",2
That's cool.,0
"Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go.",2
"Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home.",0
Nothin' to do now but wait.,2
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?,0
"Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.",2
Hm.,0
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!,2
"Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.",0
Ha ha!,2
"Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.",2
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us?,1
"Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.",2
"I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.",2
"What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?",2
...So?,2
...Yeah. So?,1
"Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?",2
"Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.",0
"Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.",2
"Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue!",0
Hey! It's Tweek.,1
"That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people!",2
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.,1
Yeah! Go!,2
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.,0
Oh God-damnit!,2
Oh no! Oh the humanity!,2
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.,1
Why can't societies just live in peace?,2
That sounds pretty fun.,0
What are they talking about?,0
"Um, cool.",0
Ih... in our... butt?,2
...Like ...money? What?,0
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts?,0
Maybe... No.,2
What are you guys doin'?,1
"We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.",0
In your butts?,1
"Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?",2
Why would he put anything in your butts?,1
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.,0
Hm.,2
Hm.,1
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?,0
"Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.",1
"Aw, dude, I think I might have it.",2
"It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?",2
"Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?",2
"Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!",1
"What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.",2
It wouldn't work!,1
Have you ever tried it?,2
I don't need to. It wouldn't work.,1
I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!,2
"You're on, fat boy!",1
"Okay, let's go, Jew!",2
"Well, Cartman?",1
"Hold on!  God, let a man crap!",2
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.,0
"Well, go on, smartass, and do it!",1
"I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!",2
"You've had five, dude!",0
"I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.",2
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!,1
"Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously.",2
Get the fuck out of here!,1
"Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!",2
"Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice.",2
"It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought-",2
"Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.",0
What? He did.,0
Yeah it does.,0
Yeah. It does.,0
You guys! You guys! Look!,2
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.,2
"So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!",2
"Go fuck yourself, Cartman!",1
"Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.",2
"Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!",1
"Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.",2
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature!,1
"Dude, look.",0
"That's stupid and immature, Cartman!",2
"It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!",1
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!,1
"You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!",2
So?,1
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey.,2
"Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.",1
"O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?",2
"You were totally, one hundred percent right.",1
Heh...  what?,2
"You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.",1
"You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!!",2
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?,0
"Oh, cool. A preview.",0
"Aw, dude, why would they do that?",0
"Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.",2
"No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C.",1
That's gay.,0
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?,0
"Goddamnit, that pissed me off!",0
"Yeah, we want our money back!",2
You asshole!,2
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!,1
"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!",0
"Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.",1
We have to do something. Let's form a club.,0
Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.,2
"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!",0
"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club",1
"Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!",2
"Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!",2
"Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!",2
Well what's wrong with it?,0
"Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here.",2
"""Free hat?""",1
"Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.",2
Well we can just make them out of paper.,2
"It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!",2
"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats.",0
Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!,2
How many hats have you made?,2
We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!,2
"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.",1
"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!",0
"Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!",2
"Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.",1
I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.,2
"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.",0
"Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.",0
"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone.",0
"Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.",2
"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?",0
"Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors?",0
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..,1
"Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!",0
"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.",0
"...212, 213, 214 members!",0
Really? That's great.,0
Yah.,1
"If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.",0
But just remember that I do all the talking.,2
You?? Why?,1
Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.,2
When did we do dibs for it?,0
Just now -  1 2 3 dibs!,2
Me.,1
"Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!",1
What could possibly go wrong?,2
"...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek.",2
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.,1
"Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.",2
"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.",1
"Yeah, we're children.",2
"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?",0
"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.",2
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?,2
"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!",1
No. NOO!!,1
"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary?",0
Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.,2
That is our understanding.,0
Nonono! We need to do this first.,1
"It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.",0
He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?,2
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider,0
"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.",0
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?,1
"Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.",2
"People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?",2
"Okay, go.",0
"Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity!",2
This looks like the right room.,1
Over here!,0
"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!",2
"Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!",2
"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.",1
"Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.",2
"Aw, really?",0
"You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen?",2
"Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-",2
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.,0
"...No, he has an icy heart.",2
"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.",1
"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song",0
It's a cool island song.,2
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.,1
"Oh, do we wanna do that?",2
"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films.",0
"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is.",1
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.,1
"You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.",0
"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society",1
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.,0
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film!,1
"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys!",0
AY!,2
He's definitely lost it,0
Yup.,1
"Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!",1
"You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.",0
"Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes!",0
"Yuh, you guys okay.",0
Yeah. I I think so.,1
"Man, that new version must have sucked balls.",2
"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here.",0
"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.",1
"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.",0
That and youth. Those guys are old.,2
"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.",0
"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.",0
"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.",1
"Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.",2
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.,2
"Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.",2
It puts the lotion back in the basket!,2
Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!,2
Yes Mom?,2
"...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?",2
Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.,2
But I wanna plaaayyy.,2
"Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?",2
"Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.",1
"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?",0
"Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?",2
It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.,2
Dude! Bebe is really smart!,1
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.,0
"Yeah, may be.",2
"Ah, hey, Bebe.",0
"Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.",0
"Yeah, it's cool.",1
Hellafun,0
"Right, heh.",2
"Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.",0
"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool.",0
Yeah. She's really cool.,1
"So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing.",0
"That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-",1
I'm showing her.,1
Hoh!,1
"Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-",1
"Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-",0
Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh!,1
Hoh hoh hoh!,0
Hah hah hah!,1
"...Wait, what were we doing again?",0
We were throwing rocks at cars.,1
Woohoo.,2
"Hey, that's what I wrote about!",0
"Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.",0
"God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.",2
That's such a great paper!,0
Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert!,2
Maybe she's in the lunch line.,1
"Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk",2
"Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.",2
"And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.",2
"And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.",2
That would be best.,0
"Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.",2
Kyle??,0
"And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts.",2
"Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!",1
"And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.",2
"Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!",0
Pleeeeease???,2
"Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts.",2
No way! Tweek's cool!,1
"Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?",2
"Sure thing, Bebe.",0
"That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool.",2
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.,1
Yeah.  Where are you guys going?,0
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?,0
Hoh!,0
Hoh hoh hoh!,1
"Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together.",0
Is Bebe home?,0
Cartman's?,0
And this is Precious.,2
"Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants.",2
"Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.""",2
"Heheh, yeah.",2
"Now say it again, louder.",2
"Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!",2
"Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!""",2
"Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!""",2
"You bitch, I'll cut your throat if-",2
What the hell are you doing?,1
"We're playing ""Lambs.""",2
"Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.",1
Hoh!,0
"Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh!",0
"Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!",0
Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!,0
Hoh. Hoh?,0
Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.,0
Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.,0
"Ahta. Ah, ahta!",0
Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.,0
Ahah,0
Ahta?,0
Friend. Ahta.,0
Ahta!,0
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.,0
Bebe's boobs?,2
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.,0
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?,1
"So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?",2
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.,1
"I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.",0
Boobs are stupid!,1
What a stupid bitch!,2
I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.,0
It will.,1
One please.,2
"Dude, relax.",2
"Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?",2
Child Tracker?,0
"...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!",0
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!,0
"So weak. So weak, dude. Man.",2
"Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!",1
"But, wait. Where's the other team?",1
"But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.",0
"Dude, we weren't playing anybody.",1
I'm not done with my pizza.,0
"Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.",0
"You're such a fatass, Cartman.",1
At least I'm not a stupid Jew.,2
But why do I have to leave?,0
Where are we supposed to go?,0
"Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.",0
"Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai.",0
Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.,2
"Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude.",0
"Yeah, it was like four days ago!",1
"Uh huh, Stan Marsh.",0
"Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ.",0
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!,0
You bet your fat clown ass it is!,2
...ticket stub?,2
Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?,0
It was such a long time ago!,1
"Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?",2
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!,0
GODDAMMIT!!!,2
We've gotta find that ticket!,0
"Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.",1
"You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember.",2
"You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.",0
"Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.",2
"Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny.",1
Kenny!!!,2
Where's Kenny??,0
"We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??",1
Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!,2
"Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.",0
Yeah. Closure.,1
What the fuck is closure?!,2
You turned him into a teapot?,2
Wewewewewewe...,2
Did you get it?,0
"Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...",2
"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny!",1
"Alright, we made it!",1
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!,0
"Let him out, Cartman!",1
...Kenny?  Kenny?!,2
Is he in there?,1
I can't see.,0
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!,2
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot!,1
It wa a trick!,0
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!,2
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!,0
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?,1
"Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!",2
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over!,0
Goddamnit! There has to be a way!,1
"Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad.",2
Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach.,2
"Cartman, come on!",0
"What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!",2
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!,0
"A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.",1
"We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.",0
Because we wanna see Kenny again.,0
Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.,1
I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car.,2
Mr. Garrison threw away his car?,0
...No.  Ey! Euuugh.,2
Cartman? Cartman?!,1
"Wha-uh, what?? What?",2
"Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!",1
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.,2
Maybe you got brain cancer.,1
Do you think?,2
"Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!",0
"Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.",0
"We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.",0
"Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.",1
"Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.",2
Do you see anything?,1
No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??,0
Grandma??,1
"Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!",2
"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.",0
"Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.",2
Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.,2
"You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.",2
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!,1
Because Jews don't believe in heaven!,2
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!,1
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.,2
HAAHH!!!,1
AH!,2
Hey Kenny.,1
Hey Kenny.,0
"In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto",2
What did you say?!,2
"I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?",2
"Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??",0
"I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.",2
You're too fat to be Kenny.,1
You're a- stupid Jew.,2
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.,0
"No, we have to see Kenny!",0
Cremated? What's that?,0
"What?? For God's sake, why??",1
Are you gonna burn me?,1
"Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.",2
"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!",0
"You did, dude! You drank his whole body!",1
That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.,2
"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny!",0
"Yeah. Good job, fatass!",1
"I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.",2
Looks like I've come to the right place.,2
"Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.",2
Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium!,2
"Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!",2
Kenny! Kenny! kenny...,2
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!,0
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!,1
"Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.",0
"Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...",2
"Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny.",1
"You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!",2
The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!,2
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket!,2
"What do you mean, fatass?",1
"I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.",2
Where??,0
I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY!,2
"Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW!",2
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.,0
Not by giving me brain damage!,2
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!,0
"Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...",2
"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done.",0
"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.",1
"...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.",2
"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...",0
"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.",1
"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.",1
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.,0
"No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.",2
"Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?",1
"Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God!",2
"Dude, come back here!",0
"Stop him, Kenny!",1
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?,0
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!,2
"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!",1
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?,0
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.,2
"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?",1
"Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!",0
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?,0
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!,1
Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire.,2
"Good job, wizard.",0
"And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.",2
"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!",1
Jews can't be Paladins.,2
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.,0
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?,2
"Man, that's crap.",2
And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.,2
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace.,0
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!,1
Prepare for battle!,2
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.,0
This sounds like a really important quest.,2
Woww.,0
This... is so cool.,2
"Gentlemen, we are off!",1
We have come to reclaim the one tape!,0
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.,1
"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house.",2
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!,1
"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings.",1
"Butters, what the hell are you doing?!",1
"Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!",1
"No, we have to return it!",0
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.,2
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.,1
"Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.",0
Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen.,2
"Oh, crap, the sixth graders!",1
"Nothing.  Hey, kid!",0
You're gay!,2
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!,0
You can't keep it.,1
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!,0
"Dude, that video is making people act strange.",1
The one tape must be returned!  Run!,2
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.,1
"I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.",2
"Oh crap, dude!",0
Hide!,1
Ogh.,0
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.,1
"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.",0
"Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.",2
"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do.",1
Open.  Bellog.,2
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.,0
We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.,1
"Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange.",0
"We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.",2
"Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.",2
Clyde's a dick.,2
"Kevin, god-damnit..!",2
"But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.",0
Talangar the Black returns from watching the video.,2
"Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?",0
"My God, this thing must really be powerful.",2
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.,1
What do we do with it?,0
Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.,1
Quiet!,2
You're acting like a bunch of assholes!,2
I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.,0
Paladin!,1
"No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?",0
"Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.",2
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.,1
We were almost killed.,1
A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!,2
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.,0
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.,0
"Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--",2
"Hey, what are you guys doing?",1
Ha!! Fags!,2
You guys. Somebody is following us.,1
It's Butters.,2
Yes. He's been following us for like two hours.,2
Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.,2
"There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up!",2
"Jimmy, are you sure?",1
Jimmy didn't stop them!,0
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.,1
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!,2
"I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!",2
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!,2
Just get across the river! They're coming!,0
"Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.",0
"Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.",1
"We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what ""lost"" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!",2
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!,0
Oh brother!,1
Where?!,0
"No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.",1
If that was possible.,2
"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!",0
Oh no! They're closed!,1
Closed?,0
We're screwed.,2
"Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!",0
Finally.  It's over.,1
Butters! No!,1
They're coming!,0
It has to go back!,1
"Let go of the tape, Butters!",1
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.,2
Middle-earth is again safe.,1
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.,2
"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.",0
...Wow.,0
Funny.,1
Not him!,1
Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.,1
"Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.",2
"No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?",2
"Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny!",2
"No, it was Kenny!",2
"Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.",0
"Hey guys, can we talk to you?",1
"Uhh, not cool.",1
"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.",0
"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.",1
"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.",0
"Aw man, this is awesome!",2
I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!,2
"Look, a covetous Jew!",2
"""Fat tits."" That's a good one.",1
"Yeah, I have to remember that.",0
"I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.",2
"Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass!",2
"Oh, no, no, no no no no.",0
"Chef, we're intolerant.",0
"Gays, I guess.",1
"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.",0
"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.",1
Are we homophobes now?,0
"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.",1
N-no?,0
"I'll take three lunches today, please.",2
"It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC.",2
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!,0
Tolerance camp?,0
"Uh, a bear?",1
"Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.",1
Aaaa!,1
People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!,1
"Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.",0
Can't... glue... any... more.,1
"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!",0
Jesus... we have to get out of here.,0
"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.",2
Yes sir!  Phew.,2
"Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey!",2
Kenny. Can't have Kenny.,2
"Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!",2
"Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.",0
"Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.",1
"Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.",0
"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.",1
"Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?",1
Hey you guys! How's it goin'?,2
"No, that's Kenny.",0
What the hell are you assholes doing here?!,2
That's Cartman.,0
"Oh, about a month.",2
He's gone again.,2
"Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.",0
We're gong to New York?,1
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?,1
Awesome!,0
"Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.",2
"Uh, over here please?",0
We have a dead friend.,1
We told you that.,0
Yee-yeah.,1
"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.",0
Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?,1
Heh hey wait a minute dude.,0
He seemed better on TV?,0
Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.,1
"Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you?",0
We don't get to go to Scotland?,0
"Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.",0
"Thanks, asshole.",2
That's us. Come on.,0
Four white birds!,1
There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.,1
"Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.",0
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?,1
"Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave.",0
I'm not going back.,1
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them.,1
"Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap!",0
"Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.",0
"I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.",0
"Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.",0
"Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.",0
"Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.",0
"Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.",0
"No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.",0
"No dude, you're a douche.",0
Then you're a stupid douche,0
I'm nine years old.,0
"You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch.",0
"Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!",2
Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!,2
"Oh, good.",2
"Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!",2
"Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!",1
"Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.",0
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!,1
"Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.",0
"Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?",0
"Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?",0
"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.",0
"Does this month, November, hold a special significance?",0
"Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'""",0
"See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.",0
"I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday.""",0
"Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money.""",0
"No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.",0
No wait.,0
Right now?,2
"Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.",2
"Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.",0
"No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?""",0
Stop it! I didn't do anything!,0
"I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely""",0
Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!,0
"Ahh, Aahhhh!",2
"Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.",0
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.,1
"Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead!",0
"No, I don't think either of us can.",0
"I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!",0
"Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!",0
"Fine, douche!",0
"Hey, ah I feel a lot better.",2
"No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.",0
"You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche.",0
"You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.",1
"There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.",0
"No, it can't be.",0
"Oh, dude!",0
Now do you people believe me?,0
God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!,2
It's still in baggage claims!,2
"Throw it away, Clyde!",1
Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.,1
So throw it away.,0
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.,1
"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.",0
...Where did you have sex with her?,1
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.,0
"Then you throw it away, smartass.",2
"Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.",0
"Aw, come on, Mom.",0
"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!",0
"Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?",0
I'm me from the past?,0
"Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!",0
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no!,0
Stop it.,0
Quit it.,0
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.,0
Wow. That's pretty cool.,1
Then how does he know our names?,2
"'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.",1
Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?,2
That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!,2
"Hey, what happens to me in the future?",1
Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser!,2
"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.",0
"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.",0
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!,0
"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?",0
"Dude, how long has your future self been around?",0
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??,0
Where is he now?,0
Liver medicine?,0
"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!",0
"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane?",0
"Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?",0
"Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters.",0
Here it is. Motivation Corp.,0
"Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go.",0
What the hell is going on here?,0
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!,0
They've all been lying to us this whole time!,0
"Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!",0
"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!",0
"It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!",0
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!,0
"...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.",0
"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to!",0
"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.",0
"Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing.",0
"Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?",0
"Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?",0
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!,0
"Fine, then you can come with me.",0
I guess this is it.,0
"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?",0
"Yes, come in, please.",2
"Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.",2
What the hell are you doing here?!,0
"I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?",2
"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go.",0
"Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?",2
"Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!",0
"That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.",2
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!,0
"Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you.",2
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.,0
"God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?",2
"Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.",2
How much is this going to cost us?,0
"Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?",2
"Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.",2
"Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches.",2
"Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.",2
"Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.",2
"Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.",2
"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.",2
"Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.",2
"The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.",2
Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.,2
"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop.",2
"That's not neato, that sucks.",0
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!,0
"Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.",2
"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!",0
"Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog",2
Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?,2
"No, that's too extreme!",0
Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?,2
"Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing!",0
"I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.",2
Hey future self.,0
"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?",0
You must know what I'm talking about.,0
"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future.",0
"No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.",0
"Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!",2
"¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!",2
"Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.",2
Marrado. Spectacularrr.,2
"God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?",2
"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.",2
"Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!",2
"Hide and go seek, huh?!",0
I don't believe that he's my future self!,0
"No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.",0
But I have to know for sure.,0
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.,0
AAAH!,0
"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.",0
"Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.",2
"Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!",2
"Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.",0
"Butters, we're running away!",0
"Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change!",0
Get the fuck out of here.,0
"Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!",0
"I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!",0
"I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.",0
"Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.",0
"Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.",2
"Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!",2
"Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!",2
You're done?,2
"Yeah, so how's it look?",2
"But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?",2
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one?,2
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.,2
"God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!",2
"Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!",2
Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!,2
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?,2
"Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone!",2
"What are you doing, Cartman?",1
I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.,2
"You guys, that's it!",2
What's it?,1
"Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now!",2
"...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.",2
"Cartman, why are you doing this?",0
"They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.",2
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?,1
Mr. Hankey!,1
"Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!",2
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.,1
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.,2
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?,1
Wow!,2
"Wuh, that smells.",0
Get the rest of the stuff you guys!,2
"Uh, I don't really wanna get on there.",0
Me neither.,1
"You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!",2
"Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!",2
"Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??",1
Awww!,0
"God, it took forever!",0
"Wow, is that where Santa lives?",2
Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?,1
"Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?",2
"Oh, that's so lame of them.",2
"Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.",2
That's what I thought.,2
"Hang on, Santa!",0
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.,2
Why would Iraqis do that? Why?,0
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!,2
Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!,2
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?!,1
"It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.",2
"Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!",0
"Oh, Christ.",2
"I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.",0
"Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!",2
"Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?",1
"Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-",2
"Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!",2
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-,2
"I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.",2
"Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!",1
"Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!",2
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!,1
"It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...",2
Jesus!,2
"Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!",0
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.,1
"This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.",2
We're here.,0
"This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.",2
"Jesus, behind you!",1
Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.,0
You bastards.,1
"Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...",0
"On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel.",1
"Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-",2
"Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!",1
"Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.",2
"RPG, four o'clock!",0
Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!,1
We brought Christmas to Iraq!,0
"Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls!",0
"Oh, God-damnit!",2
"Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!",1
"Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again!",2
"Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas.",0
"Dude, where have you been?",1
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with.,1
"Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.",0
"Ah, damn it!",1
"My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!",1
"No, Ike! You can't come to school with me.",1
"Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!",2
"Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!",1
"Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!",2
"Dude, sweet!",0
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!,1
Kick it!,1
Uuugh.,2
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.,1
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.,2
"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…",2
"No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.",2
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.,0
Yeah. This does seem really familiar.,1
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?,2
"Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?",1
"Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.",2
"No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?",0
No I don't remember that!,2
You don't?,1
"No, because the aliens erased my memory!",2
"I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.",0
"Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car.",1
And then you said,1
Weird,1
"Chef, we're in a repeat.",0
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.,1
"Aw dude, I hate repeats!",2
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.,0
"What is a proc-tologist, Chef?",1
"You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.",0
What a dick!,1
Other than his monstrous size.,1
"SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH!",2
"Haha, very funny.",2
"Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.",0
"Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?",2
"And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.",1
"Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.",2
Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.,2
Are you okay?,1
Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome!,2
Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!,2
You all right?,0
"You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!",2
"Where to now, Chef?",0
Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle.,2
"No way!  You do it, Kenny!",1
Nope! It has to be Kyle!,2
Go on.,0
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!,1
"Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite.",2
God-damnit Cartman!,1
I couldn't resist. I'm sorry.,2
Stop it Cartman!,1
Okay. Okay okay.,2
God Dammit!,1
"Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!",2
"Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is!",2
"Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!",2
That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!,1
"Oh, nice going, Cartman!",0
"All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.",2
"No, go ahead. I'm dry.",2
But it was one of the best times I've ever had.,2
Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit!,2
"This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.",2
That does it! CHARGE!,1
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.,1
"Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.",2
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?,1
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.,0
Candy bars?,1
What do we do???,0
It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!,2
Aaaah! Runrunruuun!,1
Let's go!,0
The aliens are chasing us!,1
Chef! End of the road!,0
"What are you doing, man?!",2
I think we ditched them.,1
It's the police!,0
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.,2
Chef!!,0
Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up!,0
"What the? Where are, where are we?",1
We're in the alien ship.,0
"Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!",2
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.,1
"...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.",2
Guys. Look.,0
"My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.",0
This is like my fifth time.,2
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.,0
"Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.",1
"Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.",0
"Aw God, that movie pissed me off.",2
"Okay okay, take the form of something else!",0
Santa!,2
"Nno, that's stupid too.",0
"Oooo, very nice.",2
"How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?",2
I like it.,0
"You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?",0
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?,1
Television?,0
Earth?,1
Our planet is just a reality-TV show?,0
"You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.",1
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!,0
Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth!,2
What?? Who cancelled us?,1
"Oh shit, did we do that?",0
"Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!",0
"Dude, we have to try!",1
"Please, take us to them! Please!",0
"Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?",0
"Uh, Earth?",0
"Mighty powerful network executives,",1
"Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.",0
Please don't cancel us. Please.,1
"But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.",0
"Oh my God, this is great!",1
Tell us about it!,2
"Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.",0
"Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!",0
"Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-",0
"Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong.",0
"No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!",0
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.,1
"I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.",0
There's even World War Three to look forward to.,2
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.,1
What the hell is that?,1
"Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders.",0
"What is it, Chef?",2
We didn't go to your comedy show.,2
"Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude.",0
"Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.",1
"Yeah dude, not cool.",0
"Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.",0
"Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something.",1
"Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.",2
"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.",0
"That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one.",0
"Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!",2
Can too!,2
Oh God-damnit!!,2
"Cartman, just stay out of it.",1
But they say I can't be in their club!!,2
"Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.",0
"Stay clear, guys, stay clear.",0
Yup. I'm not seeing anything.,1
"Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.",0
Mee tooo.,1
Put more clay on the balls.,2
A reindeer?,1
What a crime.,2
"Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.",0
See?,0
You can't do that!,2
You're an art teacher!,2
Mrs. Streible thinks she's so cool!,0
How dare she talk to us like that?!,1
We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.,2
"Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.",2
TP her house?,1
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.,2
"What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh!",2
"Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!",0
"Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!",2
D'you think that's enough?,0
Should be fine.,2
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.,1
"Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum.",2
Yep. All set.,2
"Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.",2
"Heh yeah, that that's right.",2
"You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?",1
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.,2
Oh.  Uuugh.,1
Is this the right house?,0
It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place.,2
"Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.",1
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!,1
"Kyle, we all agreed to do this!",0
"We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!",1
"Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch!",2
"Come on, let's go!",2
What have we done?,1
"Let's go, Kyle!",0
"We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.",1
"Aw man, that was sooo awesome!",2
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!,1
Who cares??,2
"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!",1
"Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle.",2
"Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.",0
Noo! No.  Noo!,1
Ah! Oh God! Oh God!,1
"Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.",2
"Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime.",2
Damn!,2
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?,1
"Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.",2
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.,0
"Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.",2
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?,1
"Yes, dude!",0
"Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??",2
"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...",1
"Oh, for Christ's sake!",2
"Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.",0
"Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?",2
"Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.",2
Why are they doing us one at a time?,1
"They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.",2
I can get a better deal?,1
"Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!",2
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm!,1
"Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?",2
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.,1
No need. I have one for you right here.,2
Oh. Okay. Thanks.,1
Is there anything else I can get for you?,2
"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.",1
"You do that. Goodnight, Kyle.",2
"Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.",2
"Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.",2
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.,2
Butters.,0
"Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!",2
So what should we do?,0
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.,2
"... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!",0
"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?",0
"He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us.",2
"What's this all about, Cartman?",1
"I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?",2
A boat ride?,1
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.,2
"Well, okay.",1
"Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?",2
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.,1
And you feel like you have to confess.,2
"I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!",1
"I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while.",2
"Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness.",2
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it!,1
"Won't be long, Kyle.",2
"Cartman, what are you doing?",0
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.,2
"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!",0
They did?,2
They did?,1
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.,0
Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.,1
But can I still kill Kyyyle?,2
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?,0
"Uh, can we see them-him-her?",2
You con-fessed?,1
"You guys, we can't let him do this!",1
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!,2
"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.",1
Because it was-,1
"Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?",2
"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?",2
"I still feel bad, Cartman",1
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.,2
Yeah. That makes it even worse.,1
"Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.",2
"So... so then, how can you feel bad?",2
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.,0
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.,2
"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.",0
"What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!",2
We feel bad for other people.,1
"For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?",2
"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same!",0
"Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!",2
"Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!",2
"What is it, Cartmam?",0
It's over this way! Come on!,2
"So how are things, guys?",2
"Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.",0
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.,2
"You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!",1
Can't I?,2
"Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.",1
We have to confess that we were the ones that-,1
"You, you do? How?",0
"I told them everything, you guys. It's over.",2
My consciences just caught up with me.,2
That's not fair!,1
"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!",1
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!,1
Wugh! Two weeks of this!,0
"Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.",1
"I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.",2
Oh Jesus!,1
"I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.",2
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!,1
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-,2
"Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!",1
"Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?",2
What should we do?,1
Let's go see a movie!,0
Uh... war?,0
Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?,1
"Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.",1
Yeah.  War is not my voice.,0
Bush is a Naizi,2
...Eh the... Founding who?,2
Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old!,2
"Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!",1
But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.,2
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!,0
Maaaa. M-maaaa.,2
Shut up and study!,1
"Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?",2
I'm trying to have a flashback.,2
"You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!",2
"No, you just have to study.",0
"Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.",2
"That isn't gonna work, dumbass!",1
"Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!",0
"Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying!",1
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776.,2
How?!,0
"All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!",2
"Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!",1
"Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776.",2
Cartman? Cartman??,1
Benjamin Franklin?,2
"No, turdpants, it's Kyle!",1
"Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!",2
"Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit!",1
"Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.",2
Oh no...,0
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!,2
"Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!",1
"I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!",2
"Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.",0
Or a really sweet one.,2
"Whoa, here it goes!",2
Cartman?  Cartman??,1
Aww crap.,0
Ohhh awesome!!!,2
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?,2
Oho yes! I did it I did it!,2
"Oho kick fucking ass, dude!",2
"No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.",2
"Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.",2
"Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!!",1
"But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!",1
"I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!",0
Super neato!,2
"But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.",2
"Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...",2
"And I am the official messenger boy, I am.",2
"Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.",2
"It's a bitch, ain't it?",2
"Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-",0
"Oh, Jesus...",1
"Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.",0
"Oh, no, nononono.",0
"Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-",0
"Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!",0
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?,1
"Whoa, how very very relevant.",2
"Uh, we didn't do it.",0
We didn't do our homework.,1
"Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-",0
"Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.",2
"Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.",2
"Everyone, stop! Please!",2
"If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.",2
He does?,0
He does?,1
"I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""",2
Cartman? Cartman saved the day?,1
Can't be,0
"The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.",2
What the hell are they doing now?,0
I-I don't know.,1
I hate this town. I-I really really do.,1
"...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you.",1
Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.,2
"Miss Lopez, come on out here.",2
"Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?",2
"Oh, you mean this one?",2
"There we go, Saright?",2
That's a very pretty dress.,2
"Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez",2
"Nono, Jeh-",2
Jeh-,2
Jeh,2
Jennifer Lopez,2
"Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?",2
And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you.,2
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!,2
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.,1
"Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.",2
"No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!",1
"Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.",2
"Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?",2
"Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?",2
Is nice?,2
Stop it!,1
"Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.",2
"Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!",1
"Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.",2
"She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!",1
"Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!",1
I agree. Those places are stupid.,2
"Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!",0
"Hey, I'm on your guys' side.",2
God dammit!,1
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!,2
"Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!",1
"All right all right, here's ten dollars!",2
That's not what I meant!,1
"Can we go now, please?!",1
"Yeah, I wanna leave.",2
"Stop it, Cartman!",1
"Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez.",2
What do they want?,2
S'awright?,2
What? What?,2
"Hello hello, are you still there?",2
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?,2
"Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!",2
"Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs!",2
There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!,2
"Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep.",2
"Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!""  ""You were wrong, Kyle!""  ""Nananananaaana!""  ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  Awesommme. Yeeessss.",2
Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle!,2
"Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!",2
What are you gloating about?,0
"Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.",2
"Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.",2
Jennifer Lopez?,2
Not me!,2
I'm sure it was just a mistake.,2
Shut your God-damned mouth!,2
Nobody,2
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!,2
I will,2
"Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.",1
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.,2
"Aw, God-dammit!",1
"Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.",2
That does it. I'm out.,1
What the hell are you doing?,2
"Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!",2
Sleep!,2
Moooommm!,2
Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!,2
Heyesss.,2
She's not here right now.,2
I'm not going out in his car.,2
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.,2
"I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!",2
"Aw, God dammit!  Aww- awww, dude!",2
"OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!",2
Aww crap.,2
OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!,2
I told you this would happen.,2
"Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!",1
"Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.",2
I hate you.,1
EHAGH!  Moooooommmm!,2
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!,2
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!,2
What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!,2
What news?,2
S'aright.,2
"Oh, balls!",2
Come in.  COME IN!!,1
"Guys, I need to talk to you.",2
What's the matter?,0
"I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.",2
So stop doing it!,1
Stop doing what?,2
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!,1
"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See?",2
"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!",1
I can see your lips moving!,1
See?! I just saw your lips move!,1
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.,2
What's she doing?,0
"Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!",1
"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.",0
"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!""",1
"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?",0
"YES, dude!",1
"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.",0
"Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.",2
"Quiet, Ms. Lopez.",2
Out!,1
Guys... Uh... Uh...,2
Oh Jesus.,1
"Oh no, no, nonono.",1
Stop. It.,1
"Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?",1
"I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?",2
"All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.",1
Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!,2
"Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.",2
"Awww, shit!",1
"All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything.",0
Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?,2
"Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.",1
"It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it.",0
"Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?",0
Have you reported this to any other authorities?,0
"Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.",1
We're on the case.,0
"What have you got, Marsh?",2
Detective McCormick found something interesting.,0
"Jesus, we're too late.",2
I think we can piece this case together now.,1
"Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.",1
"You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody.",0
"Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.",1
"Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!",2
His plan was to use a hammer.,0
"Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death.",2
"Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head.",0
Then saw off the arms and legs.,1
The torso he would dump into the lake.,2
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub.,0
"And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.",2
"But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog.",1
"Looks like the game is over, old man!",2
Just the news.,0
"Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.",0
"Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!",0
We're in business!,1
"Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington",2
Yes it is!,0
"Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!",2
Do you kow where your doll is?,1
"All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.",0
"You got it, Ken?",0
"All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!",1
"Put that away, dude!",0
"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.",2
No sign of forced entry.,2
But the window isn't locked.,1
"Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.",0
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.,1
We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.,2
"Hey, kid, what are you doing?",0
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!,0
"Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!",2
"Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!",1
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!,0
"Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.",2
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.,0
"Yeah, but how?",1
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.,0
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.,2
"Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!",2
Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth!,2
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.,0
"You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!",2
You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!,2
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample.,2
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!,2
Stop playing games!,2
"That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.",2
How... do you make semen come out?,1
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.,2
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.,0
"Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.",1
"Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!",2
Follow me to the bathroom.,2
"Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.",2
"Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!",2
Well pull harder!,2
Try doin' it faster,2
"Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!",2
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!,2
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!,0
Let's go!,2
Kyle!,2
What?  What??,1
"I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!",2
They've got the doll!,1
"Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down!",0
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!,0
What do we do now?,1
"Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them.",2
"Dude, we just can't tell on them.",0
"Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.",1
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!,0
We've got to do something.,1
"Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!",2
"Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!",0
Yeah! This was our hot lead!,2
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.,0
"Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!",2
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!,0
...Grrrr!!!,1
We go get the doll ourselves.,0
But they said we can't charge the front door.,1
That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.,0
"Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!",0
Did so!,0
"We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!",1
"All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!",2
We got it.,0
"Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?",0
We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.,2
"We do what we can, sir.",0
Kewl!,2
Ah... a a a meth lab?,1
"What is a meth lab, anyway?",1
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama.,0
"Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?",0
"Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it.",1
"Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-",0
Uh bonus?,2
We just wanna be junior detectives.,0
"Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.",1
Me neither.,2
"It'll get better, guys.",0
"Better how, dude?",1
"Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?",0
We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.,1
"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?",0
Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!,2
"You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.",0
Awwwwrrr-auugh.,2
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.,2
"Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.",2
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?,2
"Well, keep tryin', Butters.",2
"Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.",1
A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?,2
Un oh...,2
"Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-",1
"Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.",0
No.,1
"Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.",1
No thanks.,0
"Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.",1
Bang bang bang...,2
"Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!""",2
Thanks.,0
...I think I have a better idea.,0
"Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.",1
"Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.",0
Certainly.,1
"Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.",2
"That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.",1
Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?,2
"Wow, dude.",0
"Man, Indians have it good, huh?",2
"All right, let's go!",2
"I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!",2
"What is Native American comedy, anyway?",1
"Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.",1
I said I wanna leave.,1
"What?? No, no, I mean, I-",1
"Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude.",2
"Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!",2
Native Americans.,1
"Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here.",0
"We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!",0
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!,0
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars!,0
"Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?",2
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!,0
Dog parade?,1
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?,1
"Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!",0
"Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.",2
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!,0
"I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!",0
"The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.",1
"Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.",0
Dad.  Good luck.,0
Come on! Come on!,0
What the hell are they doing??,1
"They, they had it! They freakin' had it!",0
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.,0
A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!,0
What???,0
"You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans!",0
"Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!",0
"Come on, you guys! This is our town!",0
We can stay. And fight.,0
"Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!",2
"Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys!",0
You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies!,2
No! We won't let you destroy our town!,0
"Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.",0
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!,1
This land is not for sale.,0
"It's all right, dad.",0
"She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer.",0
You're gonna be all right.,0
"No, Dad, NO.",0
What can I do?,0
"Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!",0
"Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-",0
"Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?",0
An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.,0
"Ah! Oh, dude!",0
"Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.",0
"Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.",1
"Dude, who the hell are you?",0
What?! Get the hell out of here!,1
"Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.",0
What? Tell us?,2
"So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.",0
"Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!",2
"Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.",0
What a dork!,2
"Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall!",2
"Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.",1
"You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.",0
"Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th.",2
"Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??",0
"We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.",2
"Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover!",0
"Hi Mom, Hi Dad!",1
"I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen!",1
"Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!",0
"That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.",2
All right. Let's work it!  What the...?,0
Hey Craig.,0
"Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!",2
Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!,2
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!,0
"Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!",0
We're metrosexual!!,0
GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!!,2
"Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.",1
Dude! W-what are you doing?,0
"I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.",1
We're not straight! You're straight!,0
You're straight like a freeway!,2
"You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!",2
...So? I'm half bisexual!,2
"I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.",2
"Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.",2
"Wow, is that from Origins?",0
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-,2
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?,1
"Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.",2
"Well, what can we do about it?",0
"We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.",2
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.,0
"Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.",2
"Yeah. Wait, what?",0
"You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.",2
"Hey, what's goin' on?",0
He's not our friend.,2
No! Ah!,1
I got beat up at school... for being different.,1
No! For not being a metrosexual.,1
Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?,1
Gah! Just leave me alone!,1
GRRRRR!!,1
That does it! I know what I have to do!,1
"One ticket to New York, please.",1
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.,1
Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?,1
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!,1
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!,1
I thought of it first!,1
Did so! Did so!,1
I thought of it two days ago!,1
"Wow, we look great!",0
"Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.",2
Clear!,1
"You'd better shut up, Craig.",0
It is not!,0
"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!",0
"That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.",2
They aren't gay? Then what are they?,1
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!,1
"You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!",1
No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!,1
Mom!,1
"Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?",0
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?,1
"Yeah. It's cool, holmes.",0
"...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?",1
"Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us.",0
"Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude!",2
God-damnit!,1
God dammit!,2
"Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band.",0
Heheheheheh heheheheheh.,2
"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.",1
"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented.",0
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.,1
"Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?",2
Christian rock?!,1
"Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!",2
"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!",1
It worked for Creed!,2
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!,0
"You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!",2
"Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!",1
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!,2
"Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go!",2
What a stupid asshole!,1
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle!,2
"Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters!",2
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house!,2
"Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere!",2
"Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me.",2
"I told you, Token.",2
"Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.",2
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.,2
"Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be-",2
"Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.",2
"Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?",1
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.,1
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!,1
"Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.",1
"Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!",1
Aaaargh!,1
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!,1
"No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!",0
You got a computer?,0
"See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!",0
"All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder.",1
"Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.",0
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome!,1
What the hell is that?,0
I don't know.  Let me go check.,1
I don't know!,1
"All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.",2
"Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.",2
"Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!",2
"All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.",2
"Um, sir-",1
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.,1
What's the matter with him?,1
"We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...",1
"So, he's gonna get it, right?",1
"We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!",0
"Almost there, you guys.",2
"Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.",2
"I'm going to kill you one day, Token.",2
"Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too.",2
"No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care!",2
"No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!",2
"Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!",2
"So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.",2
"Boy, I'll say!",0
"Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.",0
"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!",1
"Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!",1
Oh hey guys. How's it going?,2
"We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!",1
"I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.",2
It is??,0
"That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!",2
"You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!",1
"It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.",2
"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!",1
"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.",0
"I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta!",2
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!,1
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.,0
"Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..",2
"I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.",2
"Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.",2
"Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage!",2
Who are you?,2
"Yeah, you guys are real hard core.",2
"Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.",2
"Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we...",2
"You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!",2
"Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.",0
"Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!",1
"Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!",0
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.,2
"Yes, we sure do.",2
"Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??",2
"Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??",2
"I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.",2
Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.,2
"Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!",2
"The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...",2
"I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.",0
"You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!",1
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop.,1
"That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.""",1
"""We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.""  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.",1
Is this for real?? This is for real!,0
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.,1
"Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.",1
"Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert.",0
"From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?!",1
"So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?",0
"I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.",1
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.,2
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.,2
"We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!",2
"Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.",1
"Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please?",2
"Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now.",2
This is the worst day of my life.,1
"Ahhh, this is the best day of my life.",2
Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?,2
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.,0
"Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!",1
You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!,2
GOD DAMMIT!!,2
Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!,2
"OH, FUCK JESUS!!",2
"Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus!",2
"Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole!",2
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.,0
"Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.",2
"You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!",1
"Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.",2
"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?",0
But they kill people.,0
"I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.",0
"With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!",2
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.,1
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.,2
"Dude, look!",1
"Dude, is that your dad?",1
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.,2
What is he saying?,0
I can't understand him.,1
Calm down! We cannot understand you!,2
Oh Jesus!,0
Old people!,2
"Oh God, they're coming!",2
Why are they all out driving at the same time?,1
Aah! There's another one!,1
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!,2
"Dad, I'm scared.",0
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!,0
"Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?",2
"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.",0
"Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.",1
"My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.",2
"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.",0
I believe that's us... thank God.,2
More old people!,2
The American Association of Retired Persons.,0
Old people gone mad!,2
Hey Dad.,0
"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?",0
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.,1
"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?",0
"All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.",0
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.,2
"We can't fight them, Cartman.",1
No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.,2
Country Kitchen Buffet?,1
"Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.",2
Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.,2
"Yeah, I remember hearing about that.",0
"Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?",1
"I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside.",2
Aw yeah!,2
We did it!,0
"...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.",0
"Well, right, or we could always do that.",2
"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!",0
"Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.",0
"And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.",0
"Dude, I hate my family.",0
"Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.",0
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.,2
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.,0
Who's joking?,2
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!,1
You have AIDS?,2
"No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.",1
Wow! Casa Bonita?!,2
What's Casa Bonita?,0
"Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!",2
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.,1
This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!,2
Who said I'm inviting you?,1
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.,2
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.,1
"Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?",2
"I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.",1
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!,2
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!,1
I have never been a dick to you.,2
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!,1
"Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?",2
"Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!""",1
"Okay, except maybe for that one time.",2
"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you.",1
"Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please!",2
"Sorry, my mind's made up.",1
"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.",2
I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.,1
"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!!",2
"Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please!",2
"I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.",1
"No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!",2
Hi Kyle.,2
"That isn't it, Cartman.",1
What isn't it?,2
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!,1
...I don't understand the difference.,2
I know you don't.,1
"Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.",2
"Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?",2
"Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?",2
"Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.",2
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice?,1
"Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!",2
"Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!",1
"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.",0
Hey Kyle.,2
Well what?,2
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?,1
"I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.",2
"Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.",1
"So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.",2
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.,1
"I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.",2
"Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?",1
"I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.",2
"That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.",1
"And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.",1
"Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!",2
"Butters, can you keep a secret?",2
"For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.",2
"A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.",2
"Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?",2
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.,2
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?,2
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.,2
"I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.",2
"According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.",2
"No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!",2
"Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!",2
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!,2
"All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.",2
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.,2
"I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.",2
"Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind.",2
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.,1
"Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally!",1
"Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.",2
"Oh. Thanks, dude.",1
Hope you have a good one. See you later.,2
Oh wait. Cartman.,1
Yes?,2
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?,1
Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?,2
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?,1
"Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.",2
"All right, let's go.",1
"Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!",2
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.,1
"Aw dude, weak.",1
"Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?",2
"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.",1
"Yeah, it's kinda weird.",0
"Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...",2
"Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.",1
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.,2
"Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there.",0
Yeah. And then we can try the football field.,1
"Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!",2
Butters!,2
"Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!",2
The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...,2
"There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.",2
"No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...",2
"We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can.",2
"Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.",2
Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita.,2
UUuuugh!!,2
Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!,2
"The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!",2
"They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.",2
"We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.",2
"Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.",2
"Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.",2
"All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.",2
"Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.",2
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.,2
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!,2
"It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!",2
We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!,2
"Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack?",2
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die!,2
"The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.",2
"We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!",2
"Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!",2
"Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.",2
"I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains!",2
"Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!",2
"We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.",2
"Yeah, it's pretty cool.",1
"""Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.",2
"Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.",0
"What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.",2
Happy Birthday to you. Happy-,2
"We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!",2
"Oh, awesome.",1
I knew he'd turn up.,0
But... Casa Bonita.,2
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!,1
But I...  but...  Stand back!,2
"Cartman, stop it!",0
I... am going... to Casa... Bonita!,2
"It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.",1
Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!,2
"Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show!",2
Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!,2
Totally.,2
"Oh, dude, what a little asshole!",1
"Yeah, screw that kid!",0
Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.,2
"Dude, that new kid is such a douche!",1
Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!,2
"Go kick his ass, Stan.",2
"Wull, maybe he won't fight.",0
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.,2
"Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!",1
"All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass.",0
"Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?",2
No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.,0
I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.,0
"Dude, stop it.",0
"Shut up, Butters!",0
What are they doing?,1
"They're just standing there, talking.",2
What happened?,1
I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.,0
He's a really nice kid.,0
"You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!",2
You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?,1
The... Book of Mormon? What's that?,0
Who's Joseph Smith?,0
What happened then?,0
"No, I was supposed to be home at eight.",0
...Hello?,0
"Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?",0
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.,0
That's not what the Harrisons said.,0
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.,0
"They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?",0
But that's just you and your friends.,0
"Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.",0
"So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?",0
See? That's what happened to me!,0
"That's what they made me think, too!",0
"Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?",2
"Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.",0
"Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.",2
"Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?",1
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.,0
"Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.",2
"Wow, you made this?",0
"Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?",2
"Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh...",0
"Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.",0
"Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter.",2
"Eeheehee, Jesus Christ.",2
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.,0
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?,0
"Yeah, but... how?",0
"Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?",0
"It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.",0
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.,0
Hey Gary.,0
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?,0
"No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?",0
"No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!",0
"I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!",0
"Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!",0
"Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?",1
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.,0
Oh no! You guys broke up?,2
"You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.",0
Oh brother.,0
"Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.",2
I don't?,0
"Damn, that kid is cool, huh?",2
"Dude, this is unbearable.",1
I'm going to kill myself.,2
"You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands.",2
"Ugh, Jesus Christ!",0
"Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one.",0
"Aw dude, this is really hard.",1
"Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey.",2
"Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing.",1
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing.,2
D'awww sick!,1
Gross dude!,2
"No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.",2
...Whoops.,0
We're sorry.,2
Oh God...,1
"Mom...  Dad, it was just a-",0
Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?,2
Yeah. This is really their fault.,1
"Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!",2
Who's Rob Reiner?,1
"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.",1
Hwat??,0
"Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.",2
"Yeah, what's the problem?",0
"Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?",1
"Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?",2
"Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.",0
"But... isn't that, kind of, lying?",1
"Isn't he awesome, you guys?",2
"Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol.",2
"Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.",2
"So, tobacco helped to build America.",1
"Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.",2
That sound perfectly reasonable.,1
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.,0
"Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.",2
"But dude, you're making stuff up.",1
"Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!",2
"Wow, a commercial?",2
"God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?",2
"Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!",1
"This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.",1
"Yeah, maybe you're right.",0
"So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!",2
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.,1
"Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?",2
"No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.",1
"Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on.",2
"Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha-",2
What are you doing?,1
"Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.",2
"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous.",1
"Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!",2
"Heh, ho-okay.",2
"Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??",2
"Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?",2
"Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.",2
I'm not eating the cupcake.,2
Jesus Christ! HAAAA!,2
"What are you doing, Cartman?",0
They're going to kill me!,2
Who's going to kill you?,1
The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!,2
"Well, get away from us then.",0
"Yeah dude, don't get us killed too.",1
You guys have to help me!,2
"No dude, get away!",1
"Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!",2
"Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!",0
"If I go, you guys go!",2
Daaaad!,0
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.,0
"Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us!",2
"Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?",0
Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!,1
"Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong!",2
Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.,1
"You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.",2
Oh all right.,0
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.,1
"Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!",1
"So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks.",0
"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.",1
"You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!",1
"It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!",0
"I don't idolize you anymore, asshole!",2
Aw awww!,2
"Well, I guess we learned our lesson.",0
"No we didn't, dude! No we didn't!",1
"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.",0
Right. What are we playing again?,2
Football.,0
"Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut!",0
"Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.",0
"What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!",2
"Yeh-heah, right!",2
What a whore!,2
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan?,1
"Come on, Stan, it's first down still.",2
"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?",0
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.,0
"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.",1
"Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?",0
"God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up.",1
"'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.",1
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.,0
"No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic.",1
"Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!",0
"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?",0
"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.",0
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.,0
Over?  Jesus...,0
...Go away.,0
"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.",1
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?,0
"God, what a fag!",2
"Dude, not now!",1
"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...",0
"Jeez, he's worse than I thought.",1
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.,1
"What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?",1
How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.,2
"Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.",2
"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me?",1
"Hey. Uh, this is Stan.",1
Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world...,2
"Can we go, please?",0
"Okay. Okay, come on you guys.",1
"No, dude, I feel worse!",0
"Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.",1
"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!",0
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control!,0
Something I should have done a long time ago.,0
"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!",0
"Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?",0
"Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.",1
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.,0
"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?",1
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.,0
"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!",1
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.,0
"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?",0
"All right, so how do I join you?",0
...'K.,0
"There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.",0
"The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-",0
They're not?,0
Well I don't drink coffee.,0
"Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!",1
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul.,0
"God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!",1
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.,0
"Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!",1
"Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!",1
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?,0
Yeah. She is.,1
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?,0
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.,1
...conformist.,0
What's the matter with you?,0
Huh? But you just got dumped,0
"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.",0
"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.",0
"Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!",1
"Hey, can I join in?",0
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?,1
"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy.",0
"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.",1
Yeah. Let's play ball.,0
No Ike! Shh!,1
Ike's not my little brother anymore?,1
"Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?",1
"You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-",1
"Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.",2
"Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.",0
"Guys.  Guys, I need your help.",1
"It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.",1
"We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!",2
"Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?",0
"Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.",1
"Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.",2
"Dude, Cartman.",0
"I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.",2
"I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-",1
"Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way.",0
"Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you.",2
"HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!",2
"Dad, don't get carried away.",0
"No! No, this can't be happening!",2
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!,2
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!!,2
"Whoa whoa, Cartman.",0
"It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!",2
"Cartman, calm down!",0
Is that true?,1
"It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.",0
"This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.",2
"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.",1
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?,2
"It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.",1
"Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.",0
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.,1
"Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.",2
"Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.",1
"Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.",1
Four.,1
How about fifty daura?,1
Fifty-five daura.,1
Okay. Sixty daura.,1
Got it.,1
We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.,2
"Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!",2
"You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.",1
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.,2
"No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?",0
"Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick!",2
"Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!",2
All right! We're going to Canada!,1
What's going on??,0
"Hey, where the hell are you going??",1
"Do something, Kyle!",0
I'm trying!,1
Look out!,2
"You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore.",0
Hey! We're in Canada!,1
"Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?",1
Oh Jesus Christ.,2
"Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?",1
So how do we get to Ottawa?,1
Which road?!,2
"All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!",0
Word!,1
Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry.,2
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.,0
"But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.",2
"That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.",1
"Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!",2
French Canada?,1
"Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.",0
We don't have time for this.,1
"Okay, you can come with us.",1
How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.,2
"God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!",1
"Can we just get going, please?",1
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.,0
How could you be so stupid!,2
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!,1
"Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW!",2
Well come on!,1
Do you think we can still make it in time?,1
"We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.",2
"Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas!",2
We need to see the new Prime Minister.,1
No. No!!,1
"Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.",1
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back.,1
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents.,2
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure.,0
"I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.",2
Really?,1
"Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-",1
"Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything.",1
But why are you making such strange laws??,1
"You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!",1
What the hell??,1
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.,2
"Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.",1
"Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?!",2
"Dude, come on.",1
"Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!",2
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year.,0
"Pfaha, so funny.",2
"Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me!",1
"Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East.",0
"Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.",0
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.,2
"Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude.",1
"Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!",2
"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.",0
I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.,2
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.,0
Parents? Parents?!  Oh God!,2
"We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.",0
Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?!,2
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!,1
"Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.",0
Kiya! Kiya!,0
Kaii yo!,1
"Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!",2
"With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.",0
"Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.",1
"What's your ninja name, Kenny?",0
Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies,2
"All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!",0
Kick ass!,2
"Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.",2
"No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.",1
"Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!",2
"You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!",1
"Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.",2
"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.",0
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig.,2
I still say this is a bad idea.,1
"Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!",0
Look what we got.,2
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.,0
"Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.",2
"Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.",0
But don't tell anybody we have them.,1
"Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do.",0
"Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!",2
"Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!",2
"Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state!",0
"We're playing Ninjas, Butters.",2
"No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.",2
"Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.",0
"Yes, and no time to do it. No time...",2
"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.",0
"Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.",1
"Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.",2
"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!",1
"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!",0
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.,2
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!,1
I have the power to have all the powers I want.,2
"That doesn't count, fatass!",1
"Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!",0
Who the hell is that?,1
"I dunno. Craig, is that you?",0
"Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.",2
"Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.",0
"Yeah, huh, I got you!",0
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!,2
"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto!",1
"All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!",2
"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.",1
All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh!,2
God dammit Cartman!,1
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!",2
Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!,0
"Oh, shit, dude!",2
"Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!",0
"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!",1
Oh man! We are in serious trouble!,1
"Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.",0
"Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay!",0
"Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.",2
"Dude, shut up!",0
I agree with Cartman!,1
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!,1
"Just stay still, Butters.",0
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!,1
"Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.",2
"If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.",1
"God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.",1
"Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.",2
"Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning.",2
"We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?",0
Dr. Shafley?,2
He's really old and going blind.,0
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...,2
We might pass him off as our pet.,0
"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!",1
"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.",0
Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here.,2
"Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!",2
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.,1
"Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.",2
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.,0
"Okay, it's clear.",0
"Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.",2
"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late!",1
"Oh shit, somebody's coming!",0
"Quick, hide Butters!",1
In here!,2
"No way, you got weapons too?!",2
Where'd you get those?,0
"Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!",2
"Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.",0
"He said, not now, Craig!",1
"Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay?",0
We're twice the ninjas you fags are!,2
"Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!",2
I swore to never fight again.,1
"We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah!",0
"Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters?",0
Oh no. Butters!,1
"Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!",0
"Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!",1
"Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!",2
"No dude, you gotta help us find him!",0
"We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!",2
Butters!,1
"Here, Butters!",2
"Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!",2
"Dude, look!",1
"Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?",1
"Nothing, just... playing.",0
"Yeah, we know.",1
"It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence!",1
"Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.",1
"Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!",2
"Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.",0
"We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!",1
"Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.",2
"Screw you, fatass!",1
"Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it.",2
I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...,1
"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.",0
"All right, the county fair's still open!",0
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.,0
"Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!",1
"What is it, Craig?",0
Where?!,1
Then it's not too late!,1
"Come on, Ninjas!",0
"Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.",0
We have to get past them!,1
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.,2
You have that power too?,1
"I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.",2
"Good luck, Bulrog.",0
"Oh, Jesus.",0
"Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.",1
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction.,2
"Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?",1
"Just run with it, dude.",0
"Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!",1
"Hey, fuck you, Kyle!",2
"Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.",1
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.,0
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.,1
"Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.",0
The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?,2
They're Olympic games for handicapped people.,1
"Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.",0
"Yeah, that'd be cool.",1
"Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.",1
"Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.",2
"...You're an asshole, Cartman.",1
What? What'd I do?,2
You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!,2
"Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000""",2
"So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!",2
"Oh no. Cartman, no!",1
"It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!",2
"That's really, really terrible, dude.",0
"Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see.",2
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!,1
Because!,1
"What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.",2
Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!,2
"Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.",2
God damn you!,1
"You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.",2
"No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.",1
"It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha!",1
Moooommmm?,2
"Um, could I get you to do something for me?",2
"Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars?",2
I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.,2
...I'll split the money with you.,2
"All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?",2
Awesome.,2
Naaaa! Daaaaa!,2
Naaaa!,2
Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!,2
...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!,2
Enter.,2
"Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive.",1
"Go on, Kyle.",2
"I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!",1
"Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-",2
"I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!",1
"Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.",2
I came here to talk about you!,1
"Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck.",2
"One thousand dollars, yeah!",2
Daaaa! Daaaa! ',2
Whoa. What the hell??,2
"Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.",2
God-damnit!,2
"All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards!",2
"Ah, screw you hippies!",2
"...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!",2
"Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '",2
"Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up!",2
Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.,2
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.,0
"What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?",2
I'm a Vulcan!,1
"All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?",2
"The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.",1
"All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.",2
No! I'm on the away team too!,1
"It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!",2
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!,1
"Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.",2
Set phasers on stun.,2
Things seem pretty quiet.,0
Yes. A little too quiet.,2
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.,1
"Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!",2
No it doesn't.,1
"Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!",2
"No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!",1
"Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!",2
"Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!",1
"Oh God, here we go again.",0
"Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!",2
He does not!,1
"How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.",2
Naw uh!,1
"Go see the movie, Kyle!",2
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.,0
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!,1
"You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.",2
People don't hate the Jews!,1
"Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.",2
...You're a stupid asshole!,1
"Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft!",2
"Yeah, I know, but I have to-",1
...Thanks.,1
Haaaah!,1
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?,1
Mom! Doorbell!,2
Mom! Answer the door!,2
"God damn it, lazy-ass whore.",2
"You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.",1
"It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?",2
"You were, you were right?",1
"Mmm, one more time, Kyle.",2
You were right.,1
"I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.",2
"Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.",0
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.,0
Dude. That movie sucked.,0
How can they even call that a movie?,0
"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.",0
"Hey, we want our money back.",0
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.,0
"That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!",0
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!,0
"We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!",0
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?,0
"Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny!",0
Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh!,1
"Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go.",0
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.,2
"Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.",0
"Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.",2
"No, no, no, no, we want our money back.",0
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?,0
"You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.",2
"Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!",0
"If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.",2
"Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!",0
"Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!",2
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!,0
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!,2
"Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!",0
"I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!",2
Wait a minute. Cartman?!,0
Eup.,2
"Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!",0
"We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!",0
"Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.",2
Tell them I'll be down shortly,2
"Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.",2
"Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.",2
"But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.",2
"Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.",2
"Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.",2
"Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.",0
"Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.",0
"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?",0
"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.",0
Tor- torture you?,0
We don't want to torture you.,0
"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?",0
"Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!",0
"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.",1
"Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.",1
"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.",1
But how can the Jews make it better??,1
"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father.",1
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet!,0
"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny?",0
"All right, let's get the hell out of here!",0
"Aah! Run, dude, run!",0
"One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!",2
"And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.""",2
Es ist Zeit fër Rache!,2
"All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!",2
Es ist Zeit für Rache!,2
"Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.",1
"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.",1
I saw The Passion!,1
Es ist Zeit für Rache!,2
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.,0
"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.",0
"Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.",0
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.,0
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-,0
Yeah. I told you that!,0
"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.",0
"Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!",1
"No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!",1
Juden!,2
Look out!!,1
"Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!",2
"Dude, what's wrong with him?",1
"He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.",0
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?,1
It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!,0
"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.",0
"Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!",2
"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche.",1
"Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass.",2
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump.,1
"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one.",0
"Hey, who are those kids?",1
...What the hell just happened?,1
"Chef, we just got served.",0
"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-",0
"Some, kids from Orange County.",0
"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.",0
But Dad-,0
"Dude, that is a sweet RC car!",1
"Yeah, let's go race it right now!",0
"We're not interested, thanks.",1
Yeah! Go Stan!,1
All right Stan!,1
Ha! You just got f'd in the a!,2
Yeah! You got served!,1
I thought I was supposed to!,0
"I, I don't know. He seems all right.",0
"Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.",0
"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?",0
"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?",0
"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.",0
"Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?",0
Great!,0
"All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.",0
The arcade?,0
"Dude, he's incredible.",0
"Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?",0
"Dude, we need you.",0
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.,0
"All right, that's three!",0
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!,0
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.,0
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.,0
So you'll do it?,0
"All right, we just need one more person!",0
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?,0
Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...,0
"Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.",0
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago.,0
"But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.",0
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.,0
"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?",0
"A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.",0
"All right, so you're sure he can dance?",0
"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?",0
"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.",0
"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.",0
"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?",0
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like-,0
"I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.",0
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.,0
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault,0
"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.",0
"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.",0
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.,0
"But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.",0
"Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies.",0
"Aw, what do we do, Chef?!",0
Butters!,0
All right Butters!,0
"All right, Butters!",2
Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.,2
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.,2
Yes. I will be your new best friend.,2
"Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.",2
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.,2
"That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.",2
"Oh, really?",2
"Heh. Wow, that sucks.",2
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.,2
"Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.",2
You saw that?,2
No way.,2
"...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?",2
"Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?",2
"Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.",2
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.,2
"Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?",2
I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?,2
"Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.",2
...No way.,2
Weak!,2
Lame!,2
AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.,2
Where is it? Where is it?!,2
Wah!,2
"Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.",2
AWESOM-O understands.,2
"Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!",2
I would like some Sunny Delight too.,2
AWESOM-O will answers the door.,2
"What the hell are you doing, fatass?",1
"Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?",0
Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.,2
"Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?",2
"Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?",2
"Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.",2
"Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.",0
"Yes, of course.",2
"Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.",1
"Suck my balls, Kyle.",2
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.,2
Lame.,2
"AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?",2
Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming.,2
Argh!,2
"Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?",2
The New Orleans Saints.,2
Seventeen.,2
"Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.",2
"Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.",2
"You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.",2
Haaaa! Haaaa!,2
AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.,2
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.,2
AWESOM-O does not understand.,2
Not cool! Totally lame!,2
Waaaaa!,2
"Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!",2
"Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!",2
"The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!",2
"I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!",2
"I said I'm a real person, asswipe!",2
"Goddamnit, get me down from here!",2
"I'm not a robot, I'm a human!",2
"Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!",2
"Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!",2
"Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!",2
"No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am!",2
I am the AWESOM-O 4000.,2
Uh... now ending fart sequence.,2
Smell sequence initiated.,2
"Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!",2
Lame...,2
"Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house.",0
"Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.",1
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs.,2
Hey Look!,1
Hey. Do you live here?,1
What's that you're wearing?,0
"Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.",2
"Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels.",2
"Whoa. Dude, no way!",0
"Oh my God, this is awesome!",2
"Dude, are these all your toys?",0
"Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?",1
"Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!",2
"Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!",2
What's wrong with his face?,1
"Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.",0
"Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.",1
Mr. Jefferson?,1
"Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!",0
They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world!,2
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.,1
"They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.",2
"Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!",2
Choo-choo train! Yay!,2
"Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.",2
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.,2
...Train together,2
...I've got time. Do youuu??,2
"Dude, what happened to your knee?",1
Mr. Jefferson!,1
Choo-choo train.,2
"Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up.",1
"Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.",1
"I know, I know. Be cool.",1
"So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?",1
And where is your mom?,1
"You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?",1
So you never met your mom?,1
"Yeah. Yeah, that counts.",1
"Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!",2
"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.",1
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!,2
"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.",1
"Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you!",2
"I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.",0
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.,0
"Fine, Mom.",0
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?,1
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!,2
"No, my parents are.",0
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!,2
"He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!",2
Kyle?,0
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!,0
"Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!",0
"Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!",2
He just showed up here.,0
"Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends.",2
"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.",1
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.,1
I know. He's here.,0
"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.",0
"Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!",0
"Come on, Blanket.",1
"Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.",2
Haaa!,0
Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!,0
"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!",0
"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls!",2
That poor kid.,1
"Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.",0
"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?",1
"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.",0
"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.",0
"Jesus Christ, dude!",1
"Stop, you fucking lunatic!",0
"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!",1
"Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?",2
"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.",1
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.,0
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on!,1
"Blanket, you in here?",0
"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay?",1
"All right dude, get in his bed.",0
"Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something.",0
"Mr. Jefferson, hello?!",2
"Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us.",1
"Go, go, ruuun!",0
Come on!,1
"Run, Blanket, Run!",0
"Hang on, Blanket!",1
"No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!",2
"Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.",2
"All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!",1
All right! Things just might work out!,1
Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?,2
"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!",2
"It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?",2
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!,1
"Dude, I'm takin' a break.",2
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!,1
"Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.",2
All you ever do is talk about your balls!,1
"It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?",2
"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!",1
"Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!",2
"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?",0
Shoveling accident.,2
"You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.",2
"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.",0
Whoa.,0
"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!",0
"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.",0
"Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.",0
"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?",0
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.,1
"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house.",0
"It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!",0
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh-,0
"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!",0
"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.",0
I wanted my job!,0
Timecist?,0
"People from the future. Right, got it.",0
"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!",1
That's right!,0
Can you speak in present-day English please?,0
"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.",0
"No, a double cheeseburger and fries!",0
"We can't understand you, asshole!",2
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!,0
"No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!",0
Aw- awwww!,0
"Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?",0
They took yer jarb!!,0
"I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better.",0
"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.",0
"Look, it's working!",2
We're doing it!,0
"Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.",0
This is really gay.,1
"Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.",2
"Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile.",0
"Butters, shut the hell up!",2
"But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!",0
"This is bullcrap, dude!",0
"Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.",2
"Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Giant Douche.""",1
Ye-heah!,2
"Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich.""",2
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.,1
"Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!",2
"It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier!",1
"Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?",1
"Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.",2
"Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?",1
"Dude, I really don't care.",0
"That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.",1
"...Wait, wait, what about Butters?",2
You hate Butters.,1
"Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?",2
"You misled him, fatass!",1
"It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.",2
"Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.",1
A giant douche.,1
A turd sandwich.,2
Giant douche.,1
Turd sandwich.,2
Awwwww!,2
"All right, it's decided. Let's all write in ""Giant Douche.""",1
"Okay. You win, Kyle.",2
All right turd sandwich!,2
Cartman? What the hell?!,1
Giant Douche sucks!,2
"You won't get more votes than us, asshole!",1
"Game on, Jew-boy!",2
Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.,1
Giant Douche is your man!,1
"Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?",0
"Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich.",1
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!,2
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?,1
I'm not voting!,0
"What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!",1
I just think this whole thing is stupid!,0
"Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.",1
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.,0
"No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.",0
"Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.",0
Puff Daddy?,0
I...,0
"""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?!",0
Aaaah!,0
...Okay. I'll vote.,0
"Hello, Clyde.",2
"We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.",2
"Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?",2
"Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?",2
"You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.",2
"So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?",2
"Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy?",2
"You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?",1
I guess...,0
"Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.",1
"Woah... wait, what are you doing?",1
I'm voting.,0
"No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.",1
"Yeah, I know.",0
"...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.",1
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.,0
"Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!",1
"Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!",0
"Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!",1
"Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.",2
"Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!",0
The whole thing is a joke!,0
B-bani-banishment?,0
"You-you're all joking, right?",0
"Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.",1
I'm not voting!,0
"Dad, isn't this a little extreme?",0
Hello?,0
What about me?,0
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.,0
"Wow, you guys really love animals.",0
I'll live with you.,0
He said I can stay.,0
"Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.",2
"Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.",0
"I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.",0
I can't. I was banished for not voting.,0
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.,0
I guess... I guess you're right.,0
Aaaah!!,0
"Oh, no! Noooo!!",2
"Ha! You lose, fatass!",1
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.,0
"Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!",0
"You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.",2
"Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass.",2
"That is fucking stupid, Cartman!",1
"Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!",2
It's time for what?,0
"Whoa, awesome!",2
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?,1
"Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!",2
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?,1
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!,2
"You only need one copy, r-tard!",1
"Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!",2
"Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop!",1
"Dude, you can't shop for crap.",2
"Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?",0
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?,2
"Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night.",1
"Why, Mr. Farkle?",1
"Cartman, stop it!",1
"What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.",2
"See?! That sucks, dude!",1
"What? That's called progress, Kyle.",2
"Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the-",1
... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks.,2
"Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores.",0
Butters?,0
Butters? What the hell are you doing?,1
"Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town.",0
"Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!",0
"Dad, oh my God!",0
"What? D-dad, are are you dying?",0
But you-your face!,0
But you run the Wall-Mart.,1
"You hate Wall-Mart, too?",1
"Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!",2
"Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.",0
"Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their-",0
"But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-",0
"No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.",1
"You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?",2
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.,1
"No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.",2
"Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?",1
"Oh, awesome!",2
"How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?",1
"Dad, you're a geologist!",0
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!,1
But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!,1
Where are they?,0
"Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!",1
"Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand.",2
"Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.",0
Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.,2
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.,1
"Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, ""Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along"" or something.",1
"I am not, Kyle!",2
"Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave.",0
"All right, fine. Come on, fatass!",1
Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.,2
I heard that!,1
You heard what?,2
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!,1
That's not what I said!,2
"Dude, come on!",0
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!,1
"Dude, we have to go!",0
"Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!",0
Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!,2
"Goddamn, that took a long time.",0
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!,1
I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!,2
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.,1
We want to talk to who's in charge.,1
Where's he?,0
So how do we stop it?,1
There has to be a way!,0
The heart of Wall-Mart?,1
"Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?",2
"You speak too much, sir!",2
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?,0
"All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home.",1
"No, dude, don't!",0
"That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!",2
"All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.",1
"I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!",2
I knew you were!,1
"No, you didn't.",2
"Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!",1
"Yes, I did!",1
Yes. I did!,1
"...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-",2
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-,1
"I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me!",2
"We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us!",1
"Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.",2
"Save it, Grandpa!",0
We've gotta find the television department.,1
"Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.",0
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.,0
"Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back!",0
I think I see the television department in the back!,1
"Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!",0
"Come on, Dad!",0
"No, dad! We need your keys!",0
There! The television department!,0
You?,0
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.,0
Where's the heart?,1
Me. I'm asking the question.,0
"Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?",0
"The question is, ""Where is the heart?""",1
It's a mirror.,0
"Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart.",0
We'd better get out of here.,1
"H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!",0
The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now!,1
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.,1
Duh.,1
"Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!",0
"Okay, hang on a second I-",1
"Right now, goddamnit!",0
"All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?",1
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.,0
Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!,1
Yeah! He just got paroled!,0
"Oh, no! No!",1
"Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?",2
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.,1
"Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!",2
"Oh, Holy Jesus, God...",2
What the hell are we gonna do??,0
It's true.,2
"He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.",2
"Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool",1
"Dude, let's play Fireman.",0
"Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.",1
Jews can't be firemen.,2
"Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!",2
"Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!",0
But how do we start a fire?,2
"Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool!",1
Do you know how to start a fire?,1
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.,0
We're firemen!,1
"Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.",0
"Don't worry, Trent.",2
"Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!",2
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!,1
"Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire!",0
We're heroes!,0
We saved the school!,1
"Put it out, put it out!",0
"Dude, we are in so much trouble!",0
My mom is gonna break my legs!,1
"Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.",2
That's true.,0
Not us. We're good kids.,1
"Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.",2
"Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!",1
Whatever. That's like five years from now.,2
"Yeah, who cares?",0
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.,0
"Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!",2
"We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!",1
"Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now.",0
"Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge?",0
"You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!",2
"Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.",1
"We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!",2
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!,1
"Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!",2
"Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.",0
"How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe.",2
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on!,0
"Dude, we shouldn't be here!",1
"Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.",0
We've come to... ask you for help.,0
We need you to protect us... from a bully.,1
"A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours.",2
"Well...  Well, what do you want?",1
"Dude, weak!",0
Wait! We'll do it.,1
"Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.",2
"You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.",0
"I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.",2
"But mom, my teacher will-",0
"Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om.""",2
But Mo-o-o-,0
"""But Mo-o-o-om.""",2
This is hopeless!,0
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?,1
"That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!",0
"No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.",0
What else has big round squishy globes?,1
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.,2
"No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?",1
"Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.",2
How do you know?!,0
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!,2
"All right, fine.",0
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.,1
"God, I hope this works.",1
Excuse me!,0
"We, we got it.",0
"Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?",1
"You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!",2
"Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?",0
Naw.,1
"Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!",1
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.,2
"Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?",0
"Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?!",2
"Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!",1
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.,0
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.,2
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!,1
"No, no, we've just gotta find better help.",0
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.,1
There is... one person.,0
Shelly?,0
"Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.",0
"Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left.",0
"Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.",0
"We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!",0
So you're gonna help us?,1
A picture of your mom's boobs?,2
Admit it was our fault?,0
"Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you.",0
"The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.",1
A lot of stupid things that we regret.,2
"See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was ""Fireman.""",0
Aaaaaaaah!,2
"Trent, look: We've realized our mistake!",0
"Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth.",2
"Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you!",1
"Stay away from us, Trent!",2
"It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!",2
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!,2
"Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!",1
"Whatever, that's like five years from now.",2
"We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa!",2
Hah! Hey!,2
And I'm Rick Cartman.,2
"Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.",2
"Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?",0
"...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?",2
"All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.",2
"Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.",2
"Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.",1
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.,2
And we're... cut! &gt;&gt; /&gt;/&gt;,0
"All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice.",2
"Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.",0
How many students is that?,2
...Craig's show??,0
What is that butthole doing now?!,2
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!,0
"Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.",2
...You're gay!,2
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.,0
"Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.",2
"God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.",2
"Hey, look, Craig just walked in.",0
"Geez, all that from a stupid video show.",1
"Go play with yourself, Craig.",2
"Your idea took about this much thought, Craig!",0
"Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!",2
"You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!""
Ah whatever, Kenny!",2
"Gah, I just don't get it.",1
"Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!",0
"Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!",1
"All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.",0
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.,1
It should be Sexy News.,2
"Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.",0
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.,1
"Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.",2
"Nice, Butters, write that down!",2
"We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...",0
And panda bears for the preschoolers.,2
Good!,0
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.,1
"We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.",2
"All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!",0
"Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.",2
"You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.",2
"Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!",2
"Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.",0
"And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.",2
"Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?",2
"Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.",1
One testicle!  What an asshole!,2
"Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.",2
"All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.",2
"Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.",0
"Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.",2
"It's boring news, Jimmy.",2
"All right, tell me about it.",2
"Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?",2
"No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.",0
We're making the news more appealing to students.,1
I knew we could do it!,0
We beat Close-up Animals!,1
"Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you!",2
Craig's new show?,0
Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.,0
I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!,2
"Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.",1
"Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!",0
"What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.",1
"How about we have us, um... hmmm.",2
"Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?",0
"Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.",0
Thee... uhhh. What if the-?,1
"Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.",2
Crab people?,0
"They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.",2
"Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.",0
"Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!",2
How about we do a show where we kill Butters?,2
"We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.",0
We have crab people. Just sayin'.,2
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!,1
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.,1
How do we know which one to use?,1
That sounds perfect.,2
"Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.",0
It's not?,1
"Oh, okay.",1
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.,0
"All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.",1
Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.,2
"Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?",1
"Stan, are you getting good ideas?",2
"Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog.",2
"Oh dude, I just got the best idea",2
"Dude, this TV show is awesome.",2
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.,0
I could watch this for days.,1
"You guys. You guys, wake up!",0
Ah!,1
"Butters, get away from me!",1
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.,0
"I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle.",2
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.,1
"You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.",0
"No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!",0
"Jesus, you may be right.",1
"They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.",2
They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school!,0
Even in the girls' bathroom!,0
We showed the shocking footage to the principal!,0
"So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested!",1
"And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.",2
"The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free.",0
Twenty-two people?! All right!,1
"Gee, what a concidence.",0
"Haha! In your face, Craig!",2
Nobody has any ideas?,0
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head.,2
"Dude, bail?",1
...I think bail.,2
...Bail.,0
"""Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.""  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch!",2
"Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.",2
"Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.",2
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.,2
"Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter",2
"Oh, Goddammit!",2
"Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman.",0
"This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.",2
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.,0
"...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.",2
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof.,0
Do it! Do it!,1
I'm gonna!,2
"Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!",1
"Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-",2
"Awww, go on and do it already!",1
"Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.",2
He's not gonna do it.,0
"And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight!",2
Eugh...,2
Wheh? Where am I?,2
Coma... How long?,2
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!,2
"Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!",2
"Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!",2
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.,2
"I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!",2
How come the outline is missing its hand?,2
"Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!",2
Guess again.,2
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.,2
"Cartman, what did you do?!",1
"Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks!",2
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!,1
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?,2
"Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!",1
"Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!",2
You don't have any powers!,1
"Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!",2
He can't do crap!,1
"Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at!",2
Ha! You see?!,1
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!,2
This is fuckin' ridiculous!,1
No. Nothing.,2
Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!,2
What the hell is wrong with these people?!,1
Hey! What about this guy?!,1
It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.,2
"Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!",1
"If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*",2
"More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.",2
Proper channels?,2
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.,2
"Ten percent, my balls, get lost!",2
"Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!",2
In court?,2
"Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.",1
Why won't anybody listen to me?!,1
"I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.",1
"Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!",0
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!,1
"Butters, Goddammit.",0
"All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it!",1
Call an ambulance.,0
"Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?",2
... 'Kay. Sweet.,2
"Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away.",2
"Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!",2
I don't even know you dude!,2
"Oh, Jesus.",2
"No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!",2
Heheh.,2
"Yes yes, I see!",2
AAAAAAAH!,2
"I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.",1
"Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me!",2
(Hey! Come over here!),2
(Hey! Help!),2
"No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.",2
"Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you!",2
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.,2
"No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.",1
You can't hurt me.,2
Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.,1
It's... nice.,0
"Okay, okay.",0
"Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home.",0
Woof.,0
"Oh, whatta?",0
What time is it?!,0
"You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.",0
"All right, I'm going now.",0
Go away! Shoo!,0
"Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!",0
"Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr!",0
"Okay, there.",0
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior?,0
Aw- awww!,0
It's dead.,0
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.,0
"Wait, wha-what?",0
"Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!",0
But I thought you meant the Son of God!,0
Uuugh!,0
"No, no-no-no.",0
Leave me alone!!,0
"All right, all right, all right! God!",0
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!,0
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!,0
"Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH!",0
Hello? Anybody in there?,0
"Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.",0
"I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!",0
"Well, you're mountain lions.",0
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.,0
"No, he didn't.",0
"No, he didn't!",0
"Oh, Goddammit!",0
"I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.",0
"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.",0
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.,1
"Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.",1
No. I'm Jewish.,1
"Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?",0
Too late?! The hell is that?!,0
"Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!",1
"It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!",0
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?!,0
"I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!",0
"Dude, what the-&#160;?",0
"Come on, dude.",0
"No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!",1
What?! Kyle?!,0
"With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!",1
"Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!",1
"Oh, stop it, Cartman!",1
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!,1
"I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle.",2
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!,1
"Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?",2
"All right, fine! Forget it!",2
"Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.",2
"No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.",0
"Dude, why do you care?!",1
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.,0
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!,1
That's not at all what happens.,2
"All right, fine!",1
"""Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.",2
"HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!",1
"Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.",0
"Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.",1
"No Santa, don't!",0
The lion cubs!,0
I took them to see how abortions are done.,0
"Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!",0
"Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.",1
"Yeah. Yeah, there is.",0
"Oh, good.",0
"Goddammit, Cartman!",1
"Dude, don't be nervous.",0
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.,1
"You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.",0
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.,2
"I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman!",1
Good luck.,0
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.,1
Oo whataya mean?,1
"Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do.",0
"Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.",2
I know. I deserve it.,1
"Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!",2
"You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...",1
"Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.",0
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do.,1
"You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.",2
Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?,1
"But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?",1
Yeah. That's right.,1
Totally! I totally understand!,1
"Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.",1
"Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?",1
"No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.",1
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.,1
Wha-a-a negroplasty??,0
"Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?",0
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black.,1
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery.,1
"Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??",1
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.,1
"Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.",1
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?,1
But Jews can't play basketball!,1
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again!,1
"Yeah, but it was totally worth it.",1
"Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!",1
"Alright, Dad!",1
"Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?",0
He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.,2
"Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.",1
"Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?",1
"All right!  Dad, I can play!",1
"Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.",0
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.,0
"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!",1
All right!  Ow. Hm.,1
"Oh Jesus, he's about to play!",0
I got it! I got the ball.,1
"Kyle, NO!",0
"Yeah, that's basically it.",0
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.,1
"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.",2
"Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?",2
"Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies.",2
"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.",2
"Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard.",2
"Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.",2
"Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit!",2
God damn hippie!,2
Get out of here!,2
"Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!",2
The college know-it-all hippies.,2
"Hey, let's ask them.",1
"All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?",0
Wha- whataya mean?,1
Who are the corporations?,0
Are you serious? We never heard that.,0
Ugh! Those dirty liars!,1
Well... Well what do we do?,0
"All right, in you go.",2
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced!,2
What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!,2
"Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.",2
"And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar!",2
"Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.",0
"Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.",0
"Please, I have to talk to you all right now!",2
"Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!",2
"I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.",2
"It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen.",2
"I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!",2
It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. ',2
What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger!,2
"Right, so how do we get back at them?",0
"Yeah, we're pissed off.",1
"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!",2
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!",1
"Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!",2
"Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you.",2
Everybody get in a single-file line!,2
"Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.",2
"You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!",2
"No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!",2
What did I do?!,2
"They're not people, they're HIPPIES!",2
"Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!",2
You... You what?,2
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!,2
You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!,2
"How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!",2
You said it!,1
"Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.",2
Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.,2
Forget it.,2
"It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!",2
Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.,2
I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.,2
Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!,2
"All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?!",2
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?,0
"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.",1
You mean like a baker and a cop?,0
"Yeah, it's called a town.",1
"All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.",2
"In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.",2
We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.,2
"Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.",2
"All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about-",2
"There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.",2
"I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had.",2
Primary engine running?,2
Navigation systems?,2
Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?,2
"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!",0
You're doing what?,1
Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?,2
"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?",0
"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?",0
"Come on, come on!",2
"No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!",2
"...All right, fine Chef, go!",2
"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.",0
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.,1
"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap?",0
Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line!,2
"You're the scientist, jackass!",2
Put them in my laptop!,2
"Hold it right there, Kyle!",2
"Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.",1
Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.,2
"Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!",2
Token sings?,0
Of course he sings. He's black.,2
Two hundred dollars.,0
"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?",0
How come we never get opportunities like that?,1
"You wanna know what it is, guys?",2
We're not talented?,1
"That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.",2
Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.,0
"Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.",2
Probably.,1
"So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!",2
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.,0
"We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.",2
He's looking at the sign.,0
"Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.",2
All right.,0
"Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.",2
"Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.",2
It's genius.,0
"Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!",2
"Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.",2
"Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.",2
This will only take a second.,2
"Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.",2
"Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.",0
"Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?",2
"Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.",2
Can I talk to you?!,1
"I'll I'll call you back, Abe.",2
I'm making it look like important people call us.,2
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!,1
...well Token doesn't know that.,2
Yes he does!,1
"Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!",1
Jew!,2
"You guys, we're gonna lose our client.",0
"Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?",2
"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.",0
"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.",1
"This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.",0
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?,2
"Welcome to the team, Token.",1
"Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!",0
"From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.",2
"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?",0
"We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.",2
"You were awesome, Token!",0
We knew you could do it!,1
"Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...",2
Twenty dollars.,1
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.,0
"Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.",0
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.,2
"Token, you signed with us!",2
What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!,2
...Oooo...,2
"Mister, you can't do this to us!",1
...Goddamnit!,2
So unfair... so unfair.,0
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!,1
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!,2
You were looking for a talent agent?,0
And what does she do?,0
"Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.",0
You've ...already done all the work?,2
"Sir, we would love to sign your wife.",1
"We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us.",2
"Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?",0
"Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.",0
"Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh!",0
There it is! American Idol contestants!,0
"Jesus, we made it just in time!",1
Excuse us!,2
Ah our client has an audition to this show.,0
Oh crap!,1
"Dude, how long is the wait?",2
"Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.",0
"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing.",0
"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-",1
"Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.",2
"Aw, just forget it!",1
"Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.",2
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!,1
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!,0
Stupid assholes!,2
"Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?",1
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!,0
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?,2
"All right, our client will do it!",0
"Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?",1
"What's ""The Contender""?",0
"Come on, Wing!",2
Let's do it Wing!,1
Go Wing!,0
"Oh my God, dude!",1
"She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.",2
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?,0
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.,2
"Oh, thanks.",0
"Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.",2
You do?,0
Four thousand dollars?,2
We won't!,0
"You guys, you guys!",0
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!,0
Get out!,1
That's four hundred for us! We did it!,2
Woohoo! Yeah!,1
Who let the dogs out?,2
Who let-?,2
"Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?",0
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.,1
"Naw, sh-she was with you!",2
"...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.",0
Wing? Wing?,2
Wing?,1
"Wing? Here, Wing!",2
Oh no!  Hey! That's our client!,0
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!,1
"Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.",2
"Two four nine all right, this is the place.",0
"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.",1
Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!,2
"Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.",2
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!,0
"Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain.",2
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!,1
"You tell 'em, Kyle!",0
"You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!",1
"Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!",0
"Dude, maybe we should give up!",1
"No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!",0
"Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!",2
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this!,2
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way!,0
Stupid talent agents!,1
"All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!",1
They killed Kenny!,1
You bastards!,0
Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!,2
"Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!",0
She had a contract with us first! We own her!,1
Her life belongs to us!,1
"Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.",0
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.,0
Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.,1
It's a lousy business. I quit.,0
"Aw aw guys, come on!",2
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.,0
Token?,1
"Token, you're... waiting tables?",2
"Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop!",2
"Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!",2
"Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on!",2
Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!,2
I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!,2
"Kenny, when did you get here?",2
"Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here.",2
"Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.",2
"Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!",2
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?,1
"It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?",0
"YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!",2
Wuh what'd I do?,1
JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!,2
"Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell.""",1
"Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.",0
Are we in trouble or something?,0
Kenny had a will?,1
Oh wow...,0
That's... really touching.,1
(looking bored) Fags!,2
"Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?",2
Please what?,0
"Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?",2
Kenny! You're alive!,1
"Dude, how'd you do that?",0
Well... well then he's NOT alive.,2
"That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?",2
"Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.",0
"Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.",2
"Um, it was um, this one time...",2
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!,1
"Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!",2
He did not!,1
Did so!,2
Did not!,1
"Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court!",2
"You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.",2
"I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.",2
"That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.",2
He's right in here.,2
Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!,1
That dirty no-good sonofabitch!,1
"Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure!",0
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?,1
"Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!",1
"Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.",0
"Yeah, come on!",1
Don't kill Kenny!,0
That's right. Respect our authoritah.,2
"We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!",1
I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!,2
"You say tomato, but I say Kenny!",1
"You say Kenny, but I say tomato!",2
"Well, what does it say?",0
Oooo.,0
"Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.",1
"You mean, Cartman's side is right?",0
"Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.",1
"Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone.",1
"This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.",1
"Aw God, I'm so borrred.",1
"Aw Jesus, not again.",0
"Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season!",1
Yes! It's over! It's over!,0
We're done! No more baseball!,2
No more boring baseball until next year!,1
We can start having fun again!,0
"All right, we did it!",2
... What?,0
Post-season?,2
Nobody said anything about a post-season.,1
No... NOOO!!,0
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.,1
Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!,2
"Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.",0
"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.",0
I know we can lose if we try.,0
"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.",1
"Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.",0
"Hundred bucks, no big whoop.",0
"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.",0
You hate this game too?,1
"Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!",0
"No, we're gonna get creamed!",1
"All right, hit one out of the park!",2
"Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.",2
"Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base.",1
Ball. Balll.,2
"That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!",2
Aw Goddamnit!,2
Crud!,1
Goddamnit...,0
Aw spit!,0
"How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!",2
We're so proud of you kids!,1
What happens if we win the State Championship game?,2
"Oh no. No, no, no!",0
"Dad? Dad, we need to talk.",0
Goddamnit.,0
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.,0

"Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.",1
"Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.",2
"Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.",2
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.,0
I know who.,1
"There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play.",1
"Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.",1
"Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.",0
I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!,2
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!,1
"Wow, he IS great at sucking.",0
We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!,2
Aw crap!,1
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.,1
"Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking.",0
"Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.",1
This can't get any worse.,0
Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting!,0
"Come on, Dad! Get up!",0
Get up! You have to fight!,1
Dad!  You're the greatest.,0
"Dude, where is she? We can't wait.",0
"God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.",1
"Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!",2
She's here!,1
She's got Colonel!,2
I want some!,1
Oh boy!,2
I want a breast!,0
"Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?",2
"But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!",0
"Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.",2
"Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good.",1
"Okay, this is everything, mom.",0
"All right, let's eat Colonel!",1
"Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!",0
"Well, I saved you all the chicken part.",2
The skin's the best part...,1
"Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow.",2
I can't believe that fat asshole!,0
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!,1
Well this time he's gone too far!,0
"Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?",0
Hello?? I've been saying this for years!,1
"Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!",0
"Yes, but he thrives on that.",1
"All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.",0
That sounds great!,1
"Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die.",2
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?,1
I think I have extra.,0
"Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?",2
Here you go.,0
"Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!",2
No! No!!,2
"Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why???",2
Cartman isn't our friend anymore.,0
We're ignoring him.,1
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!,1
"Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.",2
What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!,2
...What did you say?,2
Butters...  Butters! You can see me??,2
"Oh my God, and you can hear me??",2
"Because, Butters, I'm... dead.",2
"Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!",2
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.,2
"I don't know, but you're the only one who can.",2
"Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!",2
Butters...,2
"Butters, you have to help me!",2
"All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.",2
"Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!",2
"Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.",2
"I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!",2
Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.,2
"This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!",2
"Tell her, tell her that I love her.",2
"Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!",2
"It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!",2
Just the good times.,2
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!,1
I can't! Don't you understand?!,2
"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!",2
"All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black.",2
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.,1
"Dude, he did that to me this morning.",0
"He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.",1
"Yeah, we know better than to think that.",0
"Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.",2
"Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.",2
"Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.",2
G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!!,2
"Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?",2
What else do I have to do?!,2
Atone?,2
Not really...,2
"Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.",2
"I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.",2
I know how.,2
"Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.",2
"Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!",2
"I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?",2
"Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.",2
"I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!",2
She's gonna close soon! Come on!,2
"I told you, Butters.",2
"Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!",2
"All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.",2
Don't worry. I have a plan.,2
"They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.",2
"Yes, it's working!",2
"Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.",2
"My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.",2
"We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.",2
"Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye!",2
"Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.",0
"We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.",1
"Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.",0
You sonofabitch Butters!,2
You told me I was a ghost!,2
"How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK!",2
"Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!",2
He's what??,0
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.,0
"Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.",1
"Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.",0
"I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?",1
"Huh wuh, what's the matter?",1
"No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.",2
"Up yours, Butters.",2
"Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?",2
"Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.",2
"Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.",2
I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.,2
"Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.",2
"Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.",2
"Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.""",2
"All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.""",2
"All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful.""",2
"Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.",2
Aaagh!,2
"D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!",2
"Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.",0
"Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.",2
"Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.",0
You know how?,2
Sure I do!,0
Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.,2
"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.",0
"Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.",2
"Okay, turn on the ignition,",0
Okay...,0
We're not moving.,2
Maybe you have the parking brake on.,2
"Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button!",0
Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!,2
Jesus Christ!!!,0
"Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!!",2
Oh dude! Oh Jesus!,0
Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!,2
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!,0
I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.,2
"Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail!",2
"Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.",0
"Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here!",2
Huh oh.,0
"Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?",0
"Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?",0
"Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?",0
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?,0
"Shyeah, that was pretty funny.",2
"Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!",0
"Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!",2
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!,0
Well they should've gotten out of there!,2
Maybe they couldn't get out!,0
We did!,2
"Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.",0
"Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!",2
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?,1
Nothing,0
"Hngh, totally.",2
Aw crap!,2
"Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.",0
"Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.",0
"Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.",1
"Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.",0
"Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.",0
"Because, I know what did cause the flood.",0
George Bush?,1
Terrorists?,1
Communists?,1
Chinese radicals?,1
...Cartman?,1
...sort of.,0
Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!,1
"Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.",0
"Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.",1
"Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!",2
"Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.",1
"Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!",2
"Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.",0
"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.",0
We can't get out! The flames are too big!,1
"Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  ""Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility.""",2
"Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us!",1
"Uh, hey Dad.",0
"Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!",0
"No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.",0
"Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?",0
Help! Help!,2
"Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!",1
We have to find a way out!,0
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof!,0
"Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!",1
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone!,0
"Not so fast, Kyle.",2
Hand over the gold!,2
What gold??,1
You know what I'm talkng about!,2
"No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!",1
All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!,2
"Guys, come on!",0
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!,1
"I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!",2
"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!",1
"Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!",2
"Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!",1
I want... your Jew gold!,2
"...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!",1
"Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo!",2
"Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God!",2
"Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam.",0
...Aw man.,2
No. I broke the dam.,0
"Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.",2
I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.,0
No! I broke the fucking dam!,0
I literally broke the dam!,0
On a boat! That wasn't mine!,0
"I kept it secret, for two days!",0
"The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!",0
"Ohhh, fuck it!",0
What are all you guys doing here?,1
"Yeah, us too.",0
"Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.",2
"What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.",2
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.,1
"Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.",2
Video playback initialized.,2
"Oh my God, how does it know the answer?",0
"Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.",2
How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?,2
Good man. Any luck here?,2
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.,1
"Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.",2
"Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?",2
So what do you suggest?,0
"Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.",2
"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.",0
"No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.",2
"No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!",2
"But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.",0
"Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.",2
That's a pretty solid idea. But who?,1
"Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet.",2
"Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters.",2
Okay. One! Two!,2
"Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it.",2
"Dude, they totally think he's a girl.",2
"Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly.",2
"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.",0
"Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.",2
"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.",1
"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.",0
"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.",2
"Jesus, what are they doing in there?",1
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.,2
"Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.",1
Maybe they found him out.,0
"Come on, we gotta go check on him.",0
Can you see anything?,1
He's just dancing around.,0
That son of a bitch!,2
Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!,2
"You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.",2
Working on what?! Your dance moves?!,2
"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface!",2
Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go!,2
"Come on, Butters.",0
"Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us!",2
"Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future.",2
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.,0
"No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.",2
"Because I do, Clyde.",2
I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?,2
Wait! I don't wanna know that!,1
Will you all shut up so I can do this!?,2
"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass!",1
"Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.",0
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?,0
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.,0
Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?,2
"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.",0
Think of the power!,2
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.,1
Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.,2
"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny.",0
"Damn, Ken.",2
"Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.",0
"So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.",0
Hello? Oh hey dude.,1
"So, what are you and Wendy doing?",0
"Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.",1
Uh huh...,0
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.,1
"Yeah, well, so is your hat.",0
I can't. I'm busy.,0
...So take it with you!,0
"Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!",0
HA!,0
"Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.",1
"Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.",0
"Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?",1
Why do you say that?,0
"It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.",1
That's because I was pissed off!,0
At who?  Heh- hang on.,1
"Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!",1
"Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!",1
"Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;",1
"Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.",1
"You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you!",0
What the hell is wrong with everybody?,1
No problems at all!,0
"It's right there, see?",0
"Dude, it's totally fine.",1
I broke the egg.,2
"I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.",2
"No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.",2
Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!,2
"Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.",2
...Why are you doing this?,2
What do you want from me?,2
Yes teacher.,2
Day five. I made it!  Hello?,0
"Dude, did you hear what's happening?",1
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!,1
Governor's office?,0
"She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?",1
"Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!",0
"Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!",1
"What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!",0
Impress Wendy??,1
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!,0
What the hell are you talking about?!,1
"Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say ""See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is.""",0
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!,0
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!,0
"Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.",1
"Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.",0
"Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!",1
"Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.",0
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.,1
I don't. She's totally lame.,0
"Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.",1
"I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.",0
"Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.",1
"It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.",1
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?,0
Yeah dude. I'm sorry.,1
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!,0
Yeah. And I can still get my A!,1
"Come on, buddy, let's go!",0
Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?,1
"As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on!",0
"Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!",1
Don't fail us! We'll be right there!,1
Thanks dude!,1
There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!,0
Keep running!,1
Hang on! Wait!,1
"Teacher, our egg is... okay.",0
Gays can get married? What??,1
What did we do?,1
"Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy.",0
"Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.""  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.",2
"Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.",2
"That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!",1
"I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers.""",2
This is all a bunch of crap!,1
"Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...",2
"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!",1
"Fine, I will!",1
"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again.",2
Stupid supremacist asswipe!,1
"Dude, what's the big deal?",0
"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?",1
What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.,0
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?,1
"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.",1
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.",0
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls.,1
I just had a couple more questions about-,1
"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you.",1
Thanks Butters,1
"Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA!",2
You buying school lunch today?,0
"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.",1
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!,1
"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.",0
Hey.  That's a great idea!,1
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?,1
"Sure, for what?",0
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!,1
"Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.",0
"-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-",2
I'M GINGER!,2
Help me! Hellp mee!,2
And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!,2
So I'm gonna stay like this forever?,2
"Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!",2
"Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?",2
"Wow, Cartman. You look... different.",1
"Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.",2
"You mean,you're a ginger?",0
"Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.",2
Is that an umbrella you're using?,1
"Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.",2
"...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?",1
"What do you mean, Kyle?",2
"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.",1
"Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle.",2
"That's fine, just get it out of the way...",2
"Dude, this is going awesome.",1
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time.,0
"Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim?",2
I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?,2
But... it's me.,2
"Dude, check it out.",1
"Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside.",2
"We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.",1
"I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!",2
"Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!",2
"...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...",2
Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...,2
"Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!",2
Red Power!,2
Red Power!,2
"We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!",2
Should we tell him the truth?,0
"Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer.",1
Better red than dead!,2
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!,2
The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!,2
"There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!",2
"Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?",2
"Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!",2
"Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are!",2
"We're fine, thanks.",2
We're fine!,2
"You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!",2
Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!,2
"Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!",1
Huh? Why?,0
"Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!",1
Are you in?,1
... totally.,0
"You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.",0
Oh... hey there.,1
You guys... need... anything?,0
Let's just... let's just walk this way.,1
"More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.",0
The hell do they want?,0
"Run, dude, run!!",0
In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door!,1
"Kyle. Kyle, wake up.",0
Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we?,1
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.,0
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us!,2
"Oh Jesus, I should have known!",1
"What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled!",2
"No, we're fine! Thank you!",2
Yes! We're good!,2
"You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!",2
Cartman! I need to tell you something!,1
Go on then! Say your last words!,2
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!,1
"Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what?",2
"Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?",2
"D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.",2
"Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.",2
"See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live.",2
... Huh?,2
"Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.",2
"No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.",2
That's it! You've got it!,2
Live together!,2
"The same, you and I!",2
"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.",1
"Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!",2
"Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.",1
"Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!",2
"How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?",1
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.,0
"HA! Saving money, duhhh!",2
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.,1
"Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.",2
"No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.",0
"Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.",2
"Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.",1
Well I can't spend any money.,0
"Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag.",2
Yeah. See ya.,1
Uh what do I have to do?,0
"L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.",0
"Then how come that sign says ""Church of Scientology""?",0
Seven and two.,0
"Uhhh, sh-sure?",0
So how did I do?,0
...Huh??,0
I am?? I didn't know that!,0
What what do I do?,0
I'm totally depressed.,0
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.,0
"No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.",0
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!,0
Neither did I!,0
"Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??",0
...well but... but that's my money.,0
I hope so.,0
Thetan levels...,0
"So, this is gonna make me happy?",0
I took out the garbage yesterday.,0
Aagh!  Stupid dumb garbage!,0
I don't know!,0
"Aw dude, I need to go to bed.",0
"Yeah, I know who you are.",0
"Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.",0
"I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.",0
"Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.",0
"Dude, this is my room!",0
Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!,0
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out.,0
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.,0
"I, I guess.",0
But I don't know any of this stuff.,0
"Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.",0
"Yeah, yeah!",0
"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.",1
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.,0
"Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.",1
"Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.",0
"Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.",1
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.,0
What secret truth??,1
"I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!",0
I didn't know you were depressed.,1
"Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends!",0
"Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you.",2
"I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.",0
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.,0
"And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.",0
"I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.",0
"... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?",0
But you said that there were-,0
"But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?",0
Three million dollars?,0
"Yeah. Yeah, I get you.",0
"Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.",0
"And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.",0
"Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.",0
I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.,0
YOU told me it was a lie!,0
Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!,0
"Well go on, then! Sue me!",0
"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!",0
I'm all wet! Sweet!,2
"Dude, Jambu is the best!",1
Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!,2
Yes! Yeehehehes!,2
"Okay, where to next?",0
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.,2
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.,1
"Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.",1
"Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?",2
"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.",0
Killer.,2
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.,1
"Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine.",2
"Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.",1
South Park.,1
What do you wanna talk about?,1
Rocket ships?,1
Why? Aren't you happy here?,1
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this!,1
"Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!",2
Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!,1
"Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!",1
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out!,1
"Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?",1
"Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.",2
"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!",1
"Goddammit, say something!",1
"Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.",2
"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?",1
Sick?,1
You live on the moon?,2
Oh my God...,1
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?,0
"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,",1
"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.",1
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.,0
"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?",1
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.,1
"Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?",1
"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.",0
"Craig, Token, get the slings ready.",0
"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.",1
"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.",1
"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.",1
You can? Awesome!,1
Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.,1
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.,1
They want twenty million dollars.,1
Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?,2
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.,0
"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.",1
"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.",1
"Okay ma, thanks!",1
"Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.",2
"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?",1
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!,1
"Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??",1
He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.,2
Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.,1
"Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?",0
Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program?,0
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?,0
This rocket will fly to the moon?,0
To the moon?,0
We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?,0
Two hundred? Million?,0
"Quick, call Kyle.",0
"Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.",2
"Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.",1
We have to hurry!,2
"Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.",1
"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!",1
"No! Please, we have to go!",1
"But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.",1
All right!!,1
It belongs with its family!,1
"Tijuana, Mexico!",1
"You're going home, Willzy-x!",1
"They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?",0
"Willzy-x, I think we're here.",1
Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!,0
"Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water!",0
"Come on, guys!",1
"Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you.",1
Oh crap! There's more of them!,2
"Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x!",1
"Okay, Manuel, hit it.",0
We did it!,1
"Thanks for the ride, Manuel.",0
"All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.",1
"Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now.",2
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.,0
"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.",1
Ichi banzai,2
Ichi banzai! Kya!,2
I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.,2
"Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!",2
"Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon.",1
"Yeah, let's go.",2
Wait. Where's my Dad?,0
"He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?",1
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??,0
"Dad, weren't you watching?",0
Are you sure you're all right?,1
"Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?",0
"Sure, whatever dude.",0
Why not just pull over?,0
"Dad, we're gonna crash!",0
"Dude, I think you're being followed.",1
"No, dude, it's the police.",1
"Aww, it's all warm!",0
"Dude, what the hell is he doing?",2
I think his pants are falling down.,1
This is sooo embarrassing.,0
"You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!",2
"You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.",1
"Man, that was such a bummer.",2
"Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?",0
"Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?",0
"All right, Stan. Sure.",2
Oh Jesus.,0
Dad! What the hell are you doing?!,0
"Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!",0
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!,0
"Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!",0
"Aww, Goddammit!",0
"Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!",0
No! You don't need another beer!,0
"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.",0
"Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?",0
"Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?",0
"No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac",0
"No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.",0
"No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.",0
"Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit!",0
"Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!",0
"Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!",0
"Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!",0
... I'm eight!,0
Where? I can't see.,0
Oh my God...,0
"Dad, let's just wait our turn.",0
"I just, my dad was-",0
"No, Dad, people will see!",0
"Dad, we're going back!",0
Praise Christ.,0
"Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.",0
"No, my dad doesn't drink.",0
"Dad, Dad, Stop!",0
"Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.",0
"Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.",0
"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.",0
"Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within.",0
I've had a great teacher.,0
"No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.",0
That's probably okay if you spread it out.,0
I think you're pushing it.,0
That's not disciprine.,0
